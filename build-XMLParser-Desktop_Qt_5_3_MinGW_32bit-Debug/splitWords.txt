The
Common
Dandelion
is
one
of
the
most
easily
recognizable
flowers
in
the
United
States
But
be
careful
There
are
a
lot
of
other
flowers
that
look
like
the
Common
Dandelion
but
aren
t
To
be
sure
check
the
stem
and
make
sure
it
s
both
round
and
hollow
There
should
be
only
one
flower
on
each
stem
When
you
break
the
stem
a
milky
sap
should
ooze
out
Then
check
the
leaves
They
should
not
be
hairy
but
they
should
have
jagged
edges
shaped
like
a
lion
s
teeth
In
fact
that
s
what
the
word
dandelion
means
tooth
of
the
lion
It
is
fun
to
pick
a
ripe
seed
head
and
blow
all
the
seeds
off
the
stem
You
can
also
tie
the
stems
of
the
flowers
together
to
form
a
chain
facts
You
can
eat
Dandelions
Many
people
put
the
young
leaves
in
their
salads
old
leaves
are
bitter
and
some
people
even
dry
the
roots
and
use
them
as
a
coffee

Yellow
Hawkweed
is
a
tall
weed
about
three
feet
whose
flower
looks
a
lot
like
a
dandelion
But
unlike
the
dandelion
it
will
produce
several
flowers
in
a
cluster
at
the
top
of
the
stem
The
leaves
are
hairy
and
stay
near
the
ground
grouped
around
the
stem
which
is
also
hairy
facts
How
did
Yellow
Hawkweed
get
its
name
They
yellow
part
is
easy
look
at
the
flower
The
weed
part
is
easy
too
But
what
about
the
hawk
part
Long
ago
people
used
Yellow
Hawkweed
to
treat
poor
eyesight
They
thought
that
hawks
ate
this
plant
and
that
was
why
they
have
such
great
vision
Though
there
is
a
connection
between
our
health
and
our
diet
eating
Yellow
Hawkweed
will
not
make
you

for

because

the

Black
Hole
FAQ
Here
are
some
frequently
asked
questions
on
black
hole
s
the
strangest
objects
in
the
sky
1
Q
What
is
a
black
hole
A
A
black
hole
is
a
region
is
space
with
so
much
gravitational
attraction
that
nothing
not
even
light
can
escape
2
Q
Will
black
holes
suck
up
everything
in
the
universe
A
No
black
holes
have
an
area
around
them
called
an
event
horizon
Once
you
go
pass
this
horizon
you
ll
get
sucked
up
but
as
long
as
you
are
out
of
the
event
horizon
you
are
safe
3
Q
How
come
we
can
t
see
a
black
hole
A
No
light
emits
out
of
a
black
hole
and
if
there
is
any
light
emitting
out
of
the
black
hole
it
gets
sucked
right
back
into
the
black
hole
so
it
never
reaches
our
eyes
4
Q
What
would
happen
if
I
got
sucked
into
a
black
hole
A
You
will
be
pulled
long
and
thin
due
to
the
gravitational
tidal
forces
from
the
black
hole
Then
you
ll
be
squeezed
into
an
extremely
small
space
called
a
singularity
5
Q
What
is
a
black
hole
s
effect
on
time
A
General
relativity
A
theory
proposed
by
Albert
Einstein
that
states
how
matter
creates
gravitational
force
by
distorting
the
very
fabric
of
spacetime
and
how
matter
reacts
to
the
shape
of
spacetime
predicts
that
when
an
object
approaches
close
enough
to
a
black
hole
it
s
infall
rate
will
slow
down
as
seen
from
far
away
Also
any
signal
from
the
object
show
that
clocks
are
running
more
slowly
than
of
ours
This
difference
is
called
time
dilation
6
Q
Can
a
black
hole
transport
a
Human
being
to
one
place
to
another
A
Science
fiction
supports
such
objects
called
wormhole
s
that
transport
you
to
one
spot
in
spacetime
to
another
spot
Transporting
beings
through
a
black
hole
is
pretty
much
impossible
First
you
wouldn
t
survive
the
fall
into
a
black
hole
so
there
is
no
use
in
transporting
people
by
this
means
Second
cosmic
censorship
states
that
no
object
that
enters
a
body
with
a
singularity
such
as
a
black
hole
can
escape
Different
types
of
black
holes
have
differently
shaped
singularities
in
a
stationary
black
hole
it
is
a
point
in
a
rotating
black
hole
it
is
a
ring
If
you
passed
through
the
center
of
the
ring
without
touching
the
ring
singularity
itself
the
mathematics
predicts
you
will
come
out
somewhere
else
and
you
cannot
return
This
is
the
basis
of
the
wormhole
idea
However
the
mathematics
gives
no
indication
of
where
or
when
that
somewhere
else
is
and
no
way
to
control
or
select
it
yourself
7
Q
Do
black
holes
last
forever
A
No
black
holes
evaporate
by
a
process
called
virtual
particle
production
see
Hawking
Radiation
In
this
process
a
particle
pairs
up
with
it
s
antiparticle
at
the
event
horizon
Normally
particles
and
antiparticles
destroy
each
other
on
contact
but
in
this
case
the
black
hole
rips
the
particle
and
antiparticle
apart
before
they
can
annihilate
each
other
One
of
these
particles
fly
off
into
space
and
the
other
falls
into
the
black
hole
Since
the
one
of
the
black
holes
particles
have
just
been
lost
the
black
hole
has
lost
mass
and
since
this
is
happening
all
the
time
black
holes
are
always
losing
mass
8
Q
Will
the
sun
turn
into
a
Black
Hole
A
No
the
sun
is
not
massive
enough
If
it
was
10
times
as
massive
as
it
is
now
it
would
9
Q
If
the
sun
did
turn
into
a
Black
Hole
what
would
it
s
effect
on
our
Earth
be
A
Even
though
the
sun
won
t
turn
into
a
black
hole
if
it
did
without
gaining
or
losing
any
mass
the
only
effect
on
our
Earth
would
be
EXTREME
freezing
temperatures
The
earth
wouldn
t
get
suck
up
because
it
has
the
same
amount
of
mass
and
the
same
amount
of
gravitational
attraction
10
Q
How
many
types
of
black
holes
are
there
A
Three
a
stationary
black
hole
Schwarzschild
Black
Hole
a
rotating
black
hole
Kerr
Black
Hole
and
an
electrically
charged
black
hole
Reissner
Nordstr
m
Black
Hole
However
in
the
real
world
only
rotating
black
holes
are
likely
to
exist
nothing
in
the
universe
is
truly
stationary
and
any
electrical
charge
on
a
black
hole
would
tend
to
be
neutralized
rapidly
11
Q
What
is
a
Schwarzchild
Radius
A
It
is
the
distance
to
the
center
singulatity
of
a
stationary
black
hole
to
it
s
outer
region
Event
horizion
12
Q
Do
galaxies
contain
supermassive
black
holes
in
their
centers
A
Recent
calculations
predict
that
there
are
supermassive
black
holes
in
the
center
of
most
if
not
all
galaxies
including
the
Milky
Way

such
as
that
of
a
transverse
wave
T
is
the
number
of
crests
and
troughs
and
t
sub
1
t
sub
2
etc
are
the
lengths
of
each
continual
trough
For
example
a
line
with
a
slope
of
3
and
a
y
intercept
of
2
that
has
3
troughs
and
4
crests
where
the
first
crest
trough
accompanies
1
unit
the
second
pair
accompanies
half
a
unit
and
the
third
pair
accompanies
half
a
unit
and
the
last
pair
accompanies
a
full
unit
is
written
like
this

The
values
that
of
said
lengths
of
the
trough
crest
pairs
MUST
be
equal
to
the
slope
The
slope
while
obviously
cannot
pertain
to
a
curved
line
is
used
to
represent
the
slope
of
the
line
that
all
the
crests
and
troughs
pass
through
Let
s
look
at
the
line
we
drew
based
on
our
numbers
Ignoring
the
green
line
We
can
see
that
there
are
indeed
four
sets
of
crests
and
troughs
and
that
each
line
does
encompass
the
length
that
we
set
and
that
the
added
total
length
equals
the
slope
of
the
Initial
Line
or
line
that
the
crests
and
or
troughs
branch
off
of
Which
in
this
case
is
the
red
line
The
purple
line
is
the
actually
transverse
wave
The
green
line
is
something
I
did
in
my
spare
time
the
night
before
this
on
this
same
MS
Paint
file
Width
of
the
Crest
and
or
Trough
If
the
width
of
the
crest
or
trough
is
to
pass
1
unit
it
is
to
be
written
as
a
side
note
in
our
equation
for
example
using
the
same
line
we
drew
if
say
the
first
crest
or
trough
the
first
being
the
one
in
the
lowest
value
quadrant
was
to
extend
to
2
units
in
width
it
would
be
written
like
this
y
mx
b
t
0
t
f
tsub1
tsub2
tsub1WID
2
In
the
event
that
multiple
crests
or
troughs
have
width
that
goes
beyond
1
it
shall
be
written
as
such
y
mx
b
t
0
t
f
tsub1
tsub2
tsub1WID

tsub2WID

tsub3WID

In
the
case
that
the
width
of
a
crest
or
trough
Is
BELOW
that
of
1
unit
then
it
shall
be
written
on
the
same
format
but
where
we
put
2
before
we
would
instead
put
a
value
below
one
such
as
6
or
5
6
This
is
if
the
total
line
segment
length
is
equal
to
one
Slope
Unit
which
is
the
entire
slope
or
m
1
For
example
a
line
segment
with
a
slope
of
2
that
is
only
one
slope
unit
in
length
would
go
up
ONLY
from
one
unit
to
the
right
and
two
units
up
which
should
look
like
this
With
a
length
of
say
three
slope
units
a
line
with
the
same
slope
would
look
like
this
In
the
event
that
the
line
segment
is
equal
to
more
than
1
slope
unit
then
the
added
lengths
of
the
crests
and
troughs
must
be
equal
to
the
slope
times
the
number
of
slope
units
These
values
are
merely
an
example
The
actual
values
depend
on
the
wave
Final
observation
Here
is
an
example
of
a
more
complex
and
real
transverse
wave

The
sentence
where
it
says
positive
rotation
If
you
point
your
thumb
into
the
direction
of
the
positive
rotation
axis
and
close
your
fingers
they
show
the
direction
of
the
rotation
i
e
the
angles
get
larger
in
that
direction
How
can
i
understand
what
positive
rotation
is
to
point
my
thumb
at
it
This
sentence
needs
further
explanation
if
a
noob
is
to
continue
regards
I
would
say
that
figure
3
makes
it
fairly
clear
Presumably
in
the
tool
a
rotation
operation
can
be
implemented
by
defining
a
vector
for
the
rotation
axis
and
a
separate
value
for
the
angle
of
the
rotation
If
the
value
of
the
angle
is
positive
that
means
a
positive
rotation
following
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
To
produce
a
negative
rotation
about
the
same
axis
you
leave
the
axis
vector
the
same
and
set
the
angle
to
a
negative
value

I
agree
with
Recent
Runes
Assuming
you
re
rotating
something
about
an
axis
parallel
to
one
of
the
axes
figures
1
and
3
make
this
concept
quite
easy
to
understand
Besides
this
is
not
massively
important
needs
further
explanation
if
a
noob
is
to
continue
if
you
re
unsure
about
the
direction
of
rotation
use
Blender
to
try
it
you
can
always
Ctrl
Z
to
undo
the
rotation
if
it
went
the
wrong
way
for
you
The
text
is
only
there
to
explain
that
by
the
right
hand
rule
positive
angles
are
counterclockwise
when
viewed
from
above
the
axis
of
rotation

Cells
are
structural
units
that
make
up
plants
and
animals
also
there
are
many
single
celled
organisms
What
all
living
cells
have
in
common
is
that
they
are
small
sacks
composed
mostly
of
water
The
sacks
are
made
from
a
phospholipid
bilayer
membrane
This
membrane
is
semi
permeable
allowing
some
things
to
pass
in
or
out
of
the
cell
while
blocking
others
There
exist
other
methods
of
transport
across
this
membrane
that
we
will
get
into
later
So
what

in
a

and
thus
are
VERY
important
aspects
of

There
are
two
types
Rough
ER
Has

Smooth
ER
Does
not

ribosomes
and
tends
to
be
more
of
a
tubular
network
o
Ribosomes
half
are
on
the
Endoplasmic
Reticulum
the
other
half
are
free
in
the
cytosol
this
is
where
the
RNA
goes
for
translation
into
proteins
o
Golgi
Apparatus
important
for
glycosylation
secretion
The
Golgi
Apparatus
is
the
UPS
of
the
cell
Here
proteins
and
other
molecules
are
prepared
for
shipping
outside
of
the

o
Peroxisomes
Use
oxygen
to

in
both
plant

this
organelle
an
enzyme
called

to
break
down
hydrogen

o
Mitochondria

A
mitochondrion
does
this
through
aerobic
respiration
They
have
2
membranes
the
inner
membranes
shapes
differ
between
different
types
of
cells
but
they
form
projections
called
cristae
The
mitochondrion
is
about
the
size
of
a
bacteria
and
it
carries
its
own
genetic
material
and
ribosomes
o
Vacuoles

Parts
of
the
cell
Plasma
membrane
bilayer
The
phospholipid
bilayer
which
the
cell
membrane
is
an
example
of
is
composed
of
various
cholesterol
phospholipids
glycolipids
blagoscony
and
proteins
Below
is
an
example
of
a
simple
phospholipid
bilayer
The
smaller
molecules
shown
between
the
phospholipids
are
Cholesterol
molecules
They
help
to
provide
rigidity
or
stability
to
the
membrane
The
two
main
components
of
phospholipids
are
shown
in
these
figures
by
blue
circles
representing
the
hydrophilic
head
groups
and
by
long
thin
lines
representing
the
hydrophobic
fatty
acid
tails
Both
the
interior
of
the
cell
and
the
area
surrounding
the
cell
is
made
up
of
water
or
similar
aqueous
solution
Consequently
phospholipids
orient
themsleves
with
respect
to
the
water
and
with
each
other
so
that
the
hydrophilic
water
loving
head
groups
are
grouped
together
and
face
the
water
and
the
hydrophobic
water
fearing
tails
turn
away
from
the
water
and
toward
each
other
This
self
organization
of
phospholipids
results
in
one
of
just
a
few
easily
recognizable
structures
Cell
membranes
are
constructed
of
a
phospholipid
bilayer
as
shown
above
Smaller
structures
can
also
form
known
as
micelles
in
which
there
is
no
inner
layer
of
of
phospholipid
Instead
the
interior
of
a
micell
is
wholly
hydrophobic
filled
with
the
fatty
acid
chains
of
the
phospholipids
and
any
other
hydrophobic
molecule
they
enclose
Micelles
are
not
so
important
for
the
understanding
of
cellular
structure
but
are
useful
for
demonstrating
the
principles
of
hydrophilicity
and
hydrophobicity
and
for
contrasting
with
lipid
bilayers
At
least
10
different
types
of
lipids
are
commonly
found
in
cell
membranes
Each
type
of
cell
or
organelle
will
have
a
different
percentage
of
each
lipid
protein
and
carbohydrate
The
main
types
of
lipids
are
Cholesterol
Glycolipids
Phosphatidylcholine
Sphingomyelin
Phosphatidylethnolamine
Phosphatydilinositol
Phosphatidylserine
Phosphatidylglycerol
Diphosphatidylglycerol
Cardiolipin
Phosphatidic
acid
Nucleus
The
nucleus
contains
genetic
material
or
DNA
in
the
form
of
chromatin
It
is
a
double
membraned
structure
with
pores
on
it
These
pores
act
as
a
gateway
to
help
the
nucleoplasm
to
maintain
continuity
with
the
cytoplasm
edit
Mitochondria
A
mitochondrian
is
the
organelle
responsible
for
a
cell
s
metabolism
It
synthetizes
ATP
through
a
protein
called
ATP
synthase
Mitochondria
have
a
double
membrane
An
outer
membrane
and
a
folded
inner
membrane
The
internal
membrane
called
the
cristaeAWDQS
is
invaginated
folded
or
creased
to
maximize
surface
area
enabling
it
to
hold
more
ATP
synthases

Chloroplasts
The
inside
of
a
chloroplast
with
the
granum
circled
Chloroplasts
are
found
only
in
photosynthesizing
cells
e
g
plant
cells
Chloroplasts
carry
out
photosynthesis
by
using
several
photosystem
proteins
Chloroplasts
also
give
a
cell
its
green
colour
and
are
widely
believed
to
have
evolved
from
symbiotic
prokaryotes
that
adapted
to
live
inside
eukaryotic
cells
Physiologically
chloroplasts
are
flat
discs
usually
2
10
micrometer
in
diameter
and
1
micrometer
thick
The
chloroplast
has
a
two
membrane
envelope
termed
the
Inner
Outer
membrane
respectively
Between
these
two
layers
is
the
intermembrane
space

Ribosomes
Ribosomes
are
responsible
for
protein
synthesis
they
are
composed
of
two
subunits
that

Endoplasmic
Reticulum
The
Endoplasmic
Reticulum
ER
acts
as
a
transport
from
the
nucleus
and
ribosomes
to
the
Golgi
apparatus
There
are
two
types
of
endoplasmic
reticulum
edit
Smooth
ER
Smooth
ER
act
as
transport
for
various
things
mainly
the
RNA
from
the
nucleus
to
the
ribosomes
RNA
is
a
small
piece
of
the
DNA
code
specifically
designed
to
tell
the
ribosomes
what
to
make
Smooth
ER
appears
smooth
in
texture
hence
the
name
edit
Rough
ER
Rough
ER
are
rough
because
of
the
ribosomes
embedded
in
them
The
rough
ER
take
the
protein
to
the
Golgi
apparatus
to
be
packaged
into
vacuoles
edit
Golgi
Complex
The
Golgi
Complex
bonds
functional
groups
to
different
biomolecules
to
direct
them
to
their
respective
destinations
It
basically
packages
the
stuff
into
vacuoles
The
Golgi
Complex
looks
like
pieces
of
pita
bread
stacked
on
top
of
each
other
They
are
the
ones
that
have
their
origin
from
the
ER
They
basically
function
as
the
delivery
system
of
the
cell
edit
Vacuole
Vacuoles
are
storage
places
They
store
water
food
or
cell
waste
products
edit
Central
Vacuole
The
central
vacuole
is
found
only
in
plant
cells
It
is
filled
with
water
and
is
pressurised
like
a
balloon
This
forces
all
the
other
organelles
within
the
cell
out
toward
the
cell
wall
This
pressure
is
called
turgor
pressure
and
is
what
gives
plants
their
crisp
and
firm
structure
edit
Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes
perform
a
variety
of
metabolic
processes
and
as
a
by
product
produce
hydrogen
peroxide
Peroxisomes
use
peroxase
enzyme
to
break
down
this
hydrogen
peroxide
into
water
and
oxygen
edit
Lysosomes
Lysosomes
are
vacuoles
containing
digestive
and
destructive
membranes
In
white
blood
cells
these
are
used
to
kill
the
bacteria
or
virus
while
in
tadpole
tail
cells
they
kill
the
cell
by
separating
the
tail
from
the
main
body
They
also
do
much
of
the
cellular
digestion
involved
in
apoptosis
the
process
of
programmed
cell
death
edit
A
day
in
the
life
of
a
cell
The
nucleus
has
transcribed
a
piece
of
its
DNA
called
RNA
and
sent
it
to
the
ribosomes
embedded
in
the
rough
endoplasmic
reticulum
These
ribosomes
then
translate
the
RNA
into
valuable
protein
which
is
then
transported
to
the
Golgi
Apparatus
The
Golgi
Apparatus
packages
the
protein
into
a
secretory
vesicle
where
it
eventually
reaches
the
cell
membrane
ready
for
secretion
out
of
the
cell
and
into
the
external
environment

Reflection
Reflection
allows
programmers
to
inspect
types
and
invoke
methods
of
objects
at
runtime
without
knowing
their
data
type
at
compile
time
At
first
glance
reflection
seems
to
go
against
the
spirit
of
ML
as
it
is
inherently
not
type
safe
so
typing
errors
using
reflection
are
not
discovered
until
runtime
However
NET
s
typing
philosophy
is
best
stated
as
static
typing
where
possible
dynamic
typing
when
needed
where
reflection
serves
to
bring
in
the
most
desirable
behaviors
of
dynamic
typing
into
the
static
typing
world
In
fact
dynamic
typing
can
be
a
huge
time
saver
often
promotes
the
design
of
more
expressive
APIs
and
allows
code
to
be
refactored
much
further
than
possible
with
static
typing
This
section
is
intended
as
a
cursory
overview
of
reflection
not
a
comprehensive
tutorial
Inspecting
Types
There
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
inspect
the
type

object

most
direct
way
is
calling
the
code

code
method
inherited
from

Reflection
is

remarkable
in
that
it

write

The

mutates
the

to
produce
a

In
NET
immutable

t
really
mean
immutable
and
private
members
are
mostly
an
illusion

Working
With
Attributes

attributes

reflection
go
hand
in

Attributes
allow
programmers
to
decorate
classes
methods
members
and
other
source
code
with
metadata
used
at
runtime
Many
NET
classes
use
attributes
to
annotate
code
in
a

of
ways
it
is
only
possible
to
access
and
interpret
attributes
through

Categorisation
Like
many
Wikibookians
I
saw
noticed
your
impressive
work
on
categorisation
in
my
watchlist
I
ve
long
looked
with
dread
at
the
categorisation
schemes
as
these
desperately
need
a
lot
of
work
I
m
glad
someone
has
taken
the
initiative
on
this
important
task
One
of
my
areas
of
interest
is
project
documentation
mainly
the
help
pages
see
Help
Contents
and
a
full
list
at
User
Swift
Help
pages
and
project
resources
e
g
Wikibooks
Templates
and
Wikibooks
Maintenance
As
you
should
now
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
with
the
categorisation
aspect
of
our
project
I
was
hoping
you
migth
be
able
to
lend
a
hand
to
explain
the
cataloguing
schemes
to
others
I
just
did
a
bit
of
copyediting
on
WB
CCR
which
should
perhaps
be
moved
to
something
like
bad
link
Help
Cataloguing
and
brought
it
up
to
date
Where
did
you
read
up
on
categorisation
and
do
you
know
of
a
better
place
to
put
this
information

I
was
a
bit
nervous
when
I
first
tried
to
add
some
order
to
the
chaos
knowing
that
I
might
stir
things
up
a
bit
on
Recent
Changes
and
even
worried
that
someone
might
get
angry
I
m
glad
you
re
all
supportive
Before
I
got
the
itch
to
start
taking
the
broom
to
things
so
to
speak
I
believe
I
looked
over
Help
Category
which
is
linked
from
Help
Contents
It
s
pretty
extensive
in
covering
categories
in
general
but
at
the
time
I
was
looking
for
any
rhyme
or
reason
for
how
things
were
organized
I
already
had
knowledge
of
Mediawiki
from
my
own
use
of
it
on
my
website
I
did
a
search
on
categories
to
find
more
information
and
came
across
Wikibooks
Categories
which
I
now
see
is
linked
to
at
the
very
bottom
of
Help
Category
I
see
it
s
marked
for
cleanup
and
I
would
probably
agree
I
leave
what
the
title
ought
to
be
up
to
you
but
I
think
a
merge
of
WB
CCR
and
Wikibooks
Categories
would
be
helpful
for
explaining
guidelines
for
Wikibooks
in
particular
Help
Category
focuses
mostly
on
Mediawiki
operation
WB
CCR
mentions
book
categories
subject
categories
dewey
decimal
alphabetical
listing
and
library
of
congress
Wikibooks
Categories
contains
good
descriptions
of
subject
and
book
categories
with
no
information
on
implementation
or
mention
of
the
others
covered
by
WB
CCR
Wikibooks
Reading
Levels
could
be
good
for
incorporating
into
a
final
page
as
well
since
it
s
something
that
would
need
to
be
considered
at
the
same
time
as
the
others
I
d
certainly
be
game
for
lending
a
hand
in
explaining
cataloguing
on
a
nice
combined
page
with
all
the
information
a
prospective
Wikibook
creator
would
need
to
know
in
order
to
file
their
book
properly
for
others
to
find
it
After
all
I
d
hate
to
spend
time
trying
to
spend
time
getting
things
sorted
out
for
it
to
go
to
waste
in
a
matter
of
months
when
others
don
t
follow
the
same
pattern
Just
let
me
know
which
target
page
should
be
the
focus
for
our
efforts
on
documentation
The
following
is
some
additional
information
that
may
or
may
not
be
in
that
page
but
at
the
least
defines
for
you
my
plan
of
action
I
d
eventually
like
to
see
categories
match
up
in
structure
to
the
structure
of
subjects
with
Category
Books
by
subject
matching
Subject
Major
Subjects
from
top
down
But
as
Whiteknight
noted
above
the
subjects
were
ad
hoc
as
well
My
initial
focus
is
getting
books
I
see
in
the
categories
filed
properly
and
the
categories
filed
within
themselves
properly
Then
I
can
take
a
higher
level
look
as
Whiteknight
suggests
and
analyzing
whether
the
subjects
themselves
make
sense
I
ve
seen
the
discussion
at
Subject
talk
Major
Subjects
on
sentence
or
title
case
Guidelines
here
seem
to
point
to
book
titles
being
title
case
and
so
sentence
case
for
categories
avoids
conflicts
While
subjects
can
be
any
name
as
the
category
they
pull
from
is
in
the
code
it
d
be
nice
if
they
match
so
that
would
mean
they
should
be
sentence
case
too
It
s
why
I
made
the
subject
category
Category
European
history
to
file
all
the
books
that
were
put
in
Category
European
History
and
that
serves
as
the
one
major
example
that
defines
my
stance
on
that
in
the
absence
of
technical
changes
or
policy
changes
that
would
prevent
another
occurrence
I
d
also
like
to
note
that
Category
Fine
arts
shows
how
I
m
filing
subject
categories
within
other
subject
categories
using
nowiki
Category
Blah
PAGENAME
nowiki
In
this
way
someone
browsing
the
categories
immediately
sees
the
difference
between
a
book
s
category
and
a
subject
s
category
subject
categories
show
up
first
This
hasn
t
been
done
for
all
the
categories
yet
of
course
but
I
feel
it
will
be
helpful
to
prevent
people
from
filing
their
new
books
into
a
category
reserved
solely
for
another
book
and

post
to
showcase
some
of
your
work
and
also
to
explain
why
the
category
system
here
has
become
so
messy
over
time
A
problem
with
categories
is
that
there
is
no
unified
plan
A
lot
of
people
are
just
making
and
organizing
categories
in
an
ad
hoc
way
and
the
lack
of
planning
really
starts
to
show
after
a
while
User

The
planning
work
that
I
had
done
in
my
user
space
was
an
attempt
to
introduce
a
roadmap
of
sorts
to
future
efforts
but
obviously
that
effort
never
took
off
I
didn
t
even
get
a
complete
plan
written
down
before
I
abandoned
it
myself
If
you
find
anything
of
value
on
that
page
you
are
welcome
to
use
it
yourself
for
any
purpose
Following
the
organization
structure
of
the
WB
AS
subject
pages
is
a
reasonable
idea
but
then
again
those
pages
were
put
together
in
the
same
ad
hoc
way
that
categories
were
A
lot
of
it
was
according
to
my
whims
as
I
was
doing
it
and
so
that
structure
isn
t
completely
sane
either
My
suggestion
is
that
you
can
follow
it
so
long
as
it
makes
sense
and
don
t
follow
it
when
I
ve
obviously
done
something
stupid
it
happens
I
m
very
happy
to
help
you
out
too
just
let
me
know
what
help
you
need
and
I
ll
take
to
it
Also
never
hesitate
to
ask
if
you
have
any
questions

I
think
there
should
be
consistency
between
subjects
and
categories
but
there
are
also
some
important
differences
subjects
use
one
particular
way
of
categorization
in
the
case
of
language
books
by
continent
but
categories
can
include
several
ways
of
categorization
e
g
by
difficulty
for
native
English
speakers
Category
Languages
by
category
Also
not
all
categories
need
to
appear
in
the
subject
pages
e
g
Category
Soundbite
requests
Category
Languages
textbook
pages
Thus
while
there
should
be
consistency
hierarchies
of
categories
and
subjects
should
not
be
identical

I
am
focusing
primarily
on
matching
categories
to
subjects
and
not
the
other
way
around
Soundbite
requests
and
Languages
by
category
won
t
be
showing
up
in
Subject
Languages
I
agree
Not
every
language
has
been
marked
as
level
one
two
or
three
anyway
so
that
would
be
a
poor
choice
to
have
show
up
in
the
subject
hierarchy
Soundbite
requests
is
a
maintenance
category
so
it
also
won
t
be
showing
up
in
the
subjects

categorized
another
dozen
pages
Also
I
appreciate
your
responses
to
my
post
in
the
Reading
Room
Anyway
I
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
there
is
a
template
tlx
BookCat
that
automatically
adds
the
book
to
the
appropriate
Book
Category
It
can
be
used
on
the
main
page
of
a
book
or
any
of
its
subpages
Furthermore
you
can
add
it
to
a
template
For
example
see
what
I
ve
done
to
1
Corinthians
Every
page
contains
a
navigation
box
at
the
bottom
This
is
tlx
1
Corinthians
Navigation
I
simply
place
tlx
BookCat
into
this
template
and
now
every
page
in
1
Corinthians
is
automatically
added
to
Category
1
Corinthians
assuming
it
includes
the
navigation
template
The
reason
BookCat
is
tt
lt
includeonly
gt
tt
is
because
the
template
itself
is
not
within
a
book
and
the
reason
the
actual
category
link
is
tt
lt
noinclude
gt
tt
is
because
BookCat
does
a
better
job
see
how
the
main
page
is
separate
from
the
rest
in
the
category
listing
Most
books
don
t
have
a
common
template
like
this
but
many
do
It
might
make
life
a
little
easier
if
you
can
exploit
that
technique

I
would
like
to
add
that
there
are
several
categories
to
include
book
categories
in
particular
bad

Category
Computing
textbook
pages
bad

Category
Engineering
textbook

bad

Category
Languages
textbook

bad

Category

etc
All
book
categories
should
be
in
one
of
these
categories
and
no
other
At
least
that
s
the
way
I
understand
the
scheme

Book
Hi
Adrignola
Thanks
for
adding
the
Dewey
LOC
cats
to
Adventist
Youth
Honors
Answer
Book
That
project
has
been
a
major
part
of
my
life
for
the
past
3
5
years
I
would
have
added
it
long
ago
but
I
could
not
decide
how
it
would
be
classified
I
guess
000
is
general
works
such
as
encyclopedias
I
guess
that
fits
For
a
while
I
had
considered
breaking
this
into
nine
books
instead
of
having
it
as
one
that
would
have
made
it
easier
to
classify
It
s
just
nice
to
have
someone
be
bold
like
that
Thanks
again
I
ve
also
noticed
that
you
have
done
a
lot
of
other
categorization
work
I
was
especially
pleased
that
you
added
a
few
of
my
transcluded
modules
to
my
transcluded
category
From
that
I
can
tell
you
are
really
digging
into
things
before
making
changes
That
too
is
very
much
appreciated

I
saw
those
pages
that
I
added
to
the
transcluded
modules
when
I
first
started
trawling
the
uncategorized
pages
listing
It
was
then
that
I
realized
I
would
have
a
hard
time
figuring
out
where
to
categorize
books
without
a
bit
more
order
to
the
current
system
One
thing
led
to
another
so
now
I
m
trying
to
do
what
you
see
in
the
paragraph
above
your
comment
You
ve
made
an
impressive
number
of
pages
in
your
book
It
certainly
reflects
the
time
you
ve
spent
on
it
Given
the
classification
under
religious
organization
tlx
DDC
200
or
tlx
LOC
B
may
also
be
possibilities
The
important
thing
is
that
it
shows
up
somewhere
for
people
browsing
via
any
method
Take
care

University

mathematics
a
better
way
Is
there
some
other
way
math
books
could
be
categorized
All
mathematic
books
could
likely
be
considered
university
level
because
at
what
point
in
a
person
s
education
subjects
are
taught
can
depend
on
the
school
and
where
you
are
in
the
world
Also
unless
someone
has
gone
to
public
schools
or
a
university
they
may
not
know
which
category
to
look
for
a
book
in
using
this
approach

Probably
I
was
just
following
the
subjects
that
were
already
there
The
items
in
University
level
mathematics
were
already
targetted
for
University
Level
Mathematics
I
was
just
changing
case
I
don
t
know
enough
about
math
to
classify
them
under
say
Calculus
or
Geometry
etc
Maybe
Jomegat
could
help
with
that
and
then
Category
University
level
mathematics
and
bad
link
Subject
University
level
mathematics
can
be
deleted
It
is
a
bad
category
to
have
I
agree
but
I
m

position
knowledge
wise
about

to

I
ll
see
what
I
can
do
for
the
ones
that
are
more
obvious
to
empty
out
that
category
I
do
indeed
like
to
not
have
redundant
categories
I
was
too
focused
on
actually
creating
a
category
to

with

I
sometimes
use
Wikipedia
to
quickly
read
up
on
a
subject
I
don
t
know
anything
about
to
help
me
figure
out
ways
to
improve
categorization
If
something
doesn
t
make
sense
to
you
by
all
means
don
t
follow
it
Sometimes
its
not
a
category
that
needs
updating
but
subject
pages
or
books
because
people
do
make
improvements
to
categories
while
not
making
the
same
improvements
to
subject
pages
or
books
Being
focused
isn
t
necessary
a
bad
thing
I
appreciated
the
work
you
ve
been
putting
into
improving
the
category
system
I
hope
realizing
there
is
a
bigger
picture
won
t
cause
you
to
slow
down
any
but
will
rather
help
you
to
see
new
possibilities

Wikipedia
s
a
good
suggestion
Looking
at
the
big
picture
I
do
see
more
possible
redundancies
If
University
level
mathematics
is
no
good
Subject
Introductory
Mathematics
might
be
for
the
same
reason
Also
I
m
curious
about
the
differences
between
Subject
Mathematical
analysis
and
Subject
Calculus
and
analysis
However
Whiteknight
did
write
way
above
that
he
made
these
off
the
top
of
his
head
and
they
may
need
to
be
changed
I
do
think
I
ll
go
back
to
working
on
Computing
and
save
Mathematics
for
last
since
it
will
be
the
most
difficult
I
m
thinking
Subject
Programming
language
and
its
contents
will
need
to
be
filed
under
Subject
Compiled
languages
to
differentiate
the
content
from
Subject
Scripting
languages
and
a
possible
Subject
to
match
with
Category
Markup
languages
all
at
the
same
level
under
Subject
Programming
I
still
haven
t
fully
sorted
everything
under
Computing
either
So
that
s
my
plan
of
attack
for
later
today

Programming
is
an
area
I
know
something
about
I
don
t
really
care
for
the
current
approach
to
categorization
for
some
things
but
at
the
same
time
I
m
not
always
sure
what
can
be
done
to
improve
it
There
are
languages
that
can
be
interpreted
and
compiled
for
instance
Programming
languages
may
need
to
be
treated
similar
to
how
Category
Languages
needs
to
be
treated
by
using
a
lot
of
intermediate
categories
so
people
can
find
what
they
are
looking
for
by
following
many
different
paths
Like
maybe
Programming
languages
by
family
and
Programming
languages
by

Programming
languages
by
paradigm
Can
t
be
correctly
implemented
since
several
languages
do
cover
several
paradigms
some
don
t
Simple
examples
C
evolved
from
an
imperative
programming
language
model
but
today
it
supports
objects
C
is
by
definition
a
multiparadigm
language
so
to
be
rightly
classified
it
would
have
to
be
present
in
most
categories
even
as
a
functional
programming
language
Going
that
way
will
be
painfully
hard
br
I
m
not
stating
my
opposition
to
any
of
the
changes
Since
your
opinion
is
as
valid
as
mine
and
we
still
haven
t
got
a
community
shared
vision
on
the
issue
I
do
consider
the
changes
in
the
scale
you
are
going
a
bit
premature
a
better
way
to
go
about
it
is
to
get
the
community
backing
for
a
static
proposal
system
since
the
visions
are
too
diverse
br
I
confess
I
don
t
particularly
like
or
agree
with
some
of
the
changes
but
if
you
can
manage
to
commit
to
maintain
and
work
on
some
better
model
that
the
chaos
it
is
today
you
will
have
all
my
support
even
if
I
don
t
appreciate
all
the
changes
br
Good
luck
to
you
on
this
endeavor

I

more

talking
about
ones

that

Muggles
Guide
to
Harry
Potter
Yeah
I
m
going
to
ask
you
to
back
out
that
change
to
the
categories
The
purpose
of
the
category
I
believe
is
to
have
a
common
place
to
keep
everything
related
to
a
book
or
a
subject
mdash
though
in
the
case
of
the
subject
it
s
enough
to
have
the
landing
page
there
and
everything
else
in
the
book
can
go
off
that
one
landing
page
The
fact
that
there
are
900
pages
in
the
category
is
a
good
thing
in
my
not
so
humble
opinion
Additionally
if
all
the
pages
are
in
the
one
category
you
can
see
any
changes
to
the
book
by
going
to
the
category
page
and
looking
for
changes
on
anything
in
the
category
On
tabs
and
titles
that
seems
like
a
useful
innovation
we
can
try
that
though
I
don
t
know
how
the
PDF
tool
will
handle
it
It
will
of
course
have
to
be
done
to
all
199
chapter
pages
but
perhaps
we
can
try
it
on
PS
first
and
take
a
look
at
that
before
we
go
hog
wild
As
far
as
the
PDF
tool
goes
like
so
much
else
on
any
Wiki
it
is
maintained
by
volunteers
and
as
such
maintenance
can
be
sketchy
The
fact
that
it
doesn
t
handle
relative
links
is
a
minor
issue
apparently
as
it
can
be
worked
around
and
so
a
fix
for
that
is
low
priority

On
the
categories
I
think
I
m
going
to
have
to
argue
with
you
a
bit
Right
now
the
page
Muggles
Guide
to
Harry

Books
Chamber
of
Secrets
is
in
the
category
Muggles
Guide
to
Harry
Potter
Books
If
you
go
to
the
category
page
for
Muggles
Guide
to
Harry
Potter
it
is
not
in
the
pages
listed
as
being
in
that
category
rather
it
shows
up
as
one
of
the
pages
in
a
related
category
Muggles
Guide
to
Harry
Potter
Books
If
you
expand
that
category
you
can
see
the
books
but
not
the
chapters
within
the
books
to
see
the
chapters
you
have
to
go
to
the
Books
subpage
and
then
expand
the
related
category
Chamber
of
Secrets
If
you
really
want
to
go
in
that
direction
it
is
possible
and
may
be
useful
but
I
would
strongly
suggest
retaining
the
base
category
as

I
suspected
that
might
be
the
case
but
it
s
good
to
have
confirmation
I
don
t
see
a
PDF
linked
to
from
the
book
s
main
title
page
so
I
may
let
the
tools
I
downloaded
continue
to
work
to
try
to
make
a
PDF
file
just
for
the
heck
of
it
anyway
Thanks
for
the
tip

Not

displaytitle
should
be
removed
but
we
might
want
to
leave
the
Title
heading

the

so
it
may
be
a

And
he

My

that

it
would

Well
the
subject
categories
have
been
getting
standardized
to
sentence
case
to
avoid
conflicts
with
books
of
the
same
name
like
Category
First
aid
subject
category
and
Category
First
Aid
book
category
to
name
one
that
comes
to
mind
If
you
put
aside
the
name
case
it
does
appear
that
Category
US
law
actually
is
already
a
subcategory
of
Category
Law
unless
I
m
missing
something
The
subjects
also
appear
to
match
that
same
structure
with
Law
being
a
parent
of
US
law
I
haven
t
had
a
chance
to
go
over
the
Social
sciences
tree
yet
so
that
whole
area
is
probably
disorganized
currently
I
hope
I
ve
addressed
any
concerns
you
have

My
opinion
on
the
name
collision
is
that
books
should
avoid
generalist
titles
like
US
Law
or
Law
in
this
case
a
book
per
definition
shouldn
t
overcrowd
a
generalist
namespace
like
First
Aid
but
I
see
your
point
and
I
don
t
think
that
the
solution
to
accommodate
the
issue
is
the
best
one
I
disagree
with
having
a
book
named
only
The
US
Law
as
it
is
is
just
as
bad
The
issue
here
is
that
the
books
names
should
be
addressed
fixed
so
that
other
works
on
the
same
fields
can
be
created
and
read
on
a
even
plain
field
keeping
the
practice
will
probably
centralize
people
in
the
more
general
titles
this
was
an
issue
with
the
Programming
language
books
and
other
titles
that
was
a
reason
for
the
last
change
This
to
me
is
the
same
issue
As
for
the
structure
I
haven
t
examined
it
just
noticed
US
law
and
Law
and
didn
t
particularly
like
it
since
you
were
working
on
this
subject
I
refrained
messing
things
In
any
case
I
still
dislike
the
standardization
to
sentence
case
to
avoid
conflicts
with
books
since
it
looks
funny
and
is
just
as
scheme
to
avoid
the
real
issue
The
other
and
also
related
thing
I
have
an
opinion
regarding
categories
is
the
use
of
plurals
in
some
topic
it
seems
fine
but
a
standardization
on
the
singular
would
be
best
For
instance
Art
Architecture
and
Law
could
all
be
pluralized

Books
starting
with
A
An
or
The
don
t
sort
well
so
I
would
agree
that
The
US
Law
is
bad
Plus
there
s
more
than
one
law
in
the
US
The
category
and
subject
Art
were
both
renamed
to
Fine
arts
a
bit
ago
so
that
is
now
plural
I
ve
not
heard
Architectures
used
and
Law
would
be
better
to
cover
the
entire
legal
field
as
compared
to
Laws
which
could
be
interpreted
as
the
legislative
items
Most
of
the
categories
do
work
well
pluralized
I
m
not
sure
where
you
stand
on
that
as
you
wrote
singular
would
be
best
but
then
added
could
be
pluralized
I
certainly
agree
that
specific
titles
are
a
good
way
to
avoid
confusion
especially
for
those
that
don
t
pay
attention
to
small
details
like
whether
that
second
word
is
capitalized
or
not
The
many
C
books
do
a
good
job
of
that
Sentence
case
title
case
singular
plural
Unfortunately
like
many
hot
button
issues
of
the
day
there
s
only
one
side
or
the
other
I
have
been
leaning
toward
the
style
Wikipedia
uses
for
its
categories
namely
sentence
case
and
plural
when
it
makes
sense
I
ve
noticed
Darklama
follows
this
pattern
which
is
good
in
that
we
don
t
work
against
each
other
Since
books
are
usually
given
a
title
in
title
case
following
Wikipedia
s
lead
in
that
respect
avoids
conflicts
though
it
may
indeed
look
funny
Truth
is
we
could
go
one
way
or
the
other
on
title
sentence
case
and
singular
plural
and
no
matter
what
somebody
would
not
be
entirely
satisfied
There
s
a
cleanup
tag
on
Subject
Major
Subjects
the
top
level
subject
to
this
day
I
read
over
the
Subject
talk
Major
Subjects
discussions
on
title
versus
sentence
case
on
the
top
level
subject
page
before
I
started
working
on
things
to
try
to
decide
which
way
to
go
They
didn
t
seem
to
reach
a
consensus
there
on
the
issue
I
had
to
make
a
decision
at
that
point
how
to
proceed
otherwise
I
could
not
proceed
My
bottom
line
is
at
least
a
goal
of
consistency

I
agree
that
books
should
use
better
names
rather
then
generic
titles
but
we
have
to
deal
with
what
the
situation
is
rather
than
what
the
ideals
are
Panic
if
you
would
like
to
see
that
change
you
could
create
and
propose
a
new
policym
or
create
an
unstable
branch
of
the
naming
policy
that
tries
to
address
this
concern
I
would
likely
support
a
policy
that
required
books
and
even
chapters
to
use
more
descriptive
names
but
until
then
using
casing
and
plurals
to
differentiate
subjects
from
books
is
as
good
a
method
as
any
As
for
US
law
I
would
like
to
see
that
expanded
to
United
states
laws
or
Laws
of
the
united
states
One
of
my
things
has
been
an
attempt
to
reduce
the
use
of
abbreviations
and
acronyms
as
well
not
everyone
may
be
familiar
with
abbreviations
and
acronyms
used
and
Wikibooks
should
strive
to
be
as
geographically
location

It

to
move
some
of

However
the

intentionally

they

The

the

not

on

So
it
s
complicated
and
very
ugly
but
intentional
I
have
a
few
other

in
my

that
use
this
same
trick
or
trices
that
are
even
worse
to
do
some
fancy

I

fix
up
the
weird

w
Fine
arts
Fine
arts
The
wikipedia
article
says
this
type
of
art
is
often
expressed
in
the
production
of
art
objects
using
visual
and
performing
art
forms
including
painting
sculpture
music
dance
theatre
architecture
photography
and
printmaking
Schools
institutes
and
other
organizations
still
use
the
term
to
indicate
a
traditional
perspective
on
the
art
forms
often
implying
an
association
with
classic
or
academic
art
I
figured
the
best
option
is
to
keep
visual
and
performing
arts
under
fine
arts
but
have
fine
arts
be
under
humanities
since
the
arts
are
considered
to
be
a
field
of
humanities
This
should
also
keep
the
humanities
category
from
growing
too

Category
Education
Seems
like
your
having
some
trouble
deciding
how
best
to
categorize
books
under
there
Like
with
study
guides
all
books
are
educational
if
you
really
think
about
it
The
education
category
should
probably
have
a
very
limited
scope
Like
for
books
about
Learning
or
teaching
methods
approaches
that
aren
t
subject
specific
Educational
institutes
colleges
universities
etc
Financial
aid
programs
grants
tuitions
etc
and
School
life
Categories
like
Tertiary
education
should
IMO
be
avoided
due
to
being
dependent
on
location
If
there
are
ever
enough
books
I
would
suggest
breaking
things
down
by
country
instead
like
education
in
the
united
states
schools
of
the
united
states
financial
aids
programs
in
the
united
states
etc
How
does
that
sound
to
you

Bullet
one
will
be
Education
theory
then
Bullet
two
would
be
Educational
institutions
Bullet
three
would
be
Financial
aid
Bullet
four
would

School

You
re
right
about
the
study
guides
and
books
being
educational
I
keep
getting
stuck
in
the
existing
subjects
instead
of
being
bold
I
ll
work
to
reduce
the
redundancy
to
books
that
are
about
education
rather
than
ones
that
simply
educate
I
might
have
to
move
some
of
them
back
into
Education
temporarily
to
keep
track
of
them
just
to
let

know

After
reading
up
on
education
theory
and
education
psychology
on
Wikipedia
I
think
education
theory
is
broader
subject
area
that
includes
education
psychology
and
other
subject
areas
Education
psychology
seems
to
be
concerned
with
the
study
of
how
students
learn
I
guess
you
could
say
its
also
like
the
difference
between
theory
and
psychology
Theories
are
based
on
any
general
observations
and
Psychology
is
about
observation
of
human
behavior
which
is
a
more
specific
type
of
observation
Teaching
and
instruction
is
likely
more
about
doing
rather
then
understanding
the
whys
and
hows
or
if
you
will
applying
what
education
theory
and
education
psychology
teaches
turning
theory
into
practice
Does
that
sound
right
to
you

It
does
Thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
look
into
that
I
ll
have
to
make
sure
books
in
those
categories
match
up
with
their
subjects
On
a
brighter
note
I
ve
eliminated
several
categories
and
Education
is
already
looking
a
lot
less
crowded

Looks
like

Your
right
it
does
look
a
bit
backwards
Learning
theory
and
instructional
theory
I

are
both

Programming
categories
I
think
we
should
use
X
programming
language
for
the
category
names
to
reduce
ambiguity
Take
python
ruby
cocoa
and
java
as
examples
Python
is
also
the
name
of
a
snake
Ruby
is
also
the
name
of
gemstone
cocoa
is
also
the
name
of
a
drink
or
the
seed
extract
of
the
cocoa
bean
and
java
is
a
type
of
coffee
Oh
also
why
have
you
decided
to
abandon
the
paradigm
approach

On
paradigms
I
m
seeing
what
Panic
stated
a
while
back
blockquote
Can
t
be
correctly
implemented
since
several
languages
do
cover
several
paradigms
some
don
t
Simple
examples
C
evolved
from
an
imperative
programming
language
model
but
today
it
supports
objects
C
is
by
definition
a
multiparadigm
language
so
to
be
rightly
classified
it
would
have
to
be
present
in
most
categories
even
as
a
functional
programming
language
Going
that
way
will
be
painfully
hard
blockquote
The
languages
from
what
I
ve
seen
have
evolved
from
one
type
to
another
and
so
seeing
their
presence
under
one
paradigm
you
d
have
to
wonder
at
what
time
in
the
lifespan
of
the
language
does
this
apply
Also
since
most
are
multiparadigm
you
end
up
with
the
multiparadigm
category
having
nearly
as
many
subcategories
as
Category
Programming
languages
by
family
has
right
now
In
addition
categorizing
them
will
be
difficult
as
Wikipedia
does
not
have
consistency
w
List
of
programming
languages
by
category
doesn
t
often
match
what
the
pages
for
the
individual
programming
languages
say
making
it
hard
to
determine
which
is
correct
And
most
people
looking
for
a
book
will
have
a
specific
language
in
mind
the
way
I
look
at
it
I
do
believe
your
other
idea
on
categorizing
by
operating
system
would
be
more
useful
to
those
newer
programmers
and
it
would
be
less
ambiguous
as
well
if
anything
other
than
families
is
implemented
at
all
If
you
were
really
set
on
paradigms
I
could
reverse
that
but
the
above
constitutes
the
line
of
thinking
I
ve
been
on
since
the
idea
was
first
proposed
I
can
recategorize
the
books
into
X
programming
languages
later
today
I
was
just
matching
the
existing
subcategories
for
families
for
consistency
but
I
can
go
the
other
way
because
you
make
a
good
argument

By
operating
system
would
have
similar
problems
but
I
do
think
there
needs
to
be
ways
to
compare
languages
to
help
new
users
make
an
informed
decision
when
deciding
what
programming
language
s
to
learn
without
having
to
do
a
lot
of
research
first
By
operating
system
would
be
more
friendly
for
new
users
than
paradigms
By
family
was
really
intended
to
identify
languages
with
a
common
ancestry
Like
there
are
many
variants
of
the
Basic
programming
language
that
share
a
common
history
despite
being
widely
different
from
each
other
There
are
also
variants
of
Lisp
Each
architecture
has
its
own
assembly
language
but
tend
to
share
some
common
history
as
well
OTOH
languages
like
C
C
and
Java
while
having
similar
grammar
aren
t
really
part
of
the
same
language
family
Looking
at
w
Comparison
of
programming
languages
I
m
thinking
maybe
by
operating
system
by
intended
use
and
by
standards
could
be
useful
to
a
general
audience
in
addition
to
by
family
which
is
likely
more
useful
for
an
intermediate
or
advanced
audience
So
if
you
plan
to
substitute
by
paradigm
with
something
else
I
can
accept
its
deletion
just
keep
in
mind
the
alternatives
may
not
be
any
better
or
worse
then

Are
you
sure

delete
is
the
right
thing
I
m
not
a

anymore

won
t
deleting
a

turn
all
the

to

page
into

and
someone
will
have

Isn
t
a

better
suited
I
don
t
have
any
experience
with
wikibooks
but
just
wanted
to
comment
since
i
m
one
of
the
few
who
contribute
to
the
content
geared
for
high
schoolers
I
just
don
t
want
anybody
to
be
unaware
that
the
page
is
moved
since
it
will
come
up
as
having
been
deleted
Doesn
t
move
and
redirect
work
better
for
this

for
deletion
because
I
filed
the

in

test
The
ACT
book
was
moved
to

and
so
won

need
it

You
re
not
the
first
person
to
ask
that
BookCat
evaluates
whether
it
s
placed
on
a
subpage
or
not
to
determine
what
code
is
used
to
categorize
Since
the
main
book
page
is
automatically
put
in
the
book
s
category
when
tlx
Subjects
is
used
BookCat
should
never
be
used
in
a
situation
where
it
s
on
the
main
book
page
I
know
they
have
that
additional
code
in
there
just
in
case
but
I
feel
there
s
no
need
to
involve
parser
functions
on
the
page
when
I
can
just
paste
in
the
code
that
BookCat
would
evaluate
to
anyways
and
save
some
processing
when
the
page
is
viewed
tlx
BookCat
is
only
linked
to
from
Using
Wikibooks
Cleanup
and
Maintenance
and
it
says
blockquote
If
you
do
not
know
what
book
category
to
use
or
how
to
use
it
tag
every
page
in
the
book
with
tlxs
BookCat
This
will
automatically
add
the
book
pages
to
the
proper
categories
blockquote
It
s
commonly
transcluded
and
not
substituted
But
if
I
follow
guidelines
and
substitute
it
I
ll
have
all
the
code
in
the
template
put
on
the
page
As
I
said
above
it
has
more
than
is
needed
when
I
m
aware
of
the
page
I
m
working
on
so
pasting
in
nowiki
Category
FULLBOOKNAME
FULLCHAPTERNAME
nowiki
also
saves
length
as
compared
to
the
documented
method
of
using
it
via
substitution

That
s
very
helpful
perspective
thanks
The
suggestion
from
Whiteknight
to
use
subst
with
BookCat
is
certainly
based
on
a
different
set
of
priorities
from
mine
one
of
the
things
I
always
liked
about
BookCat
is
that
it
simplifies
administrative
code
on
content
pages
which
is
only
true
if
it
s
transcluded
Of
course
I
actually
don
t
use
it
directly
in
the
book
I
mainly
contribute
to
because
I
ve
built
it
into
the
Template
Navlist
Doc
Navlist
Top
and
Bottom
templates
mdash
but
then
again
the
Navlist
templates
are
themselves
a
pretty
spectacular
exercise
in
preferring
intensive
transclusion
over
visible
content
page
complexity

You
are
quite
welcome
I
m
doing
quite
a
bit
of
categorizing
lately
Both
your
book
s
main
page
and
the
category
of
the
same
name
are
filed
in
Category
School
life
which
is
a
category
in
Category
Education
which
is
a
category
in
Category
Social
sciences
which
is
a
category
in
Category
Books
by
subject
Rather
than
filing
a
book
at
every
level
of
the
hierarchy
books
have
been
filed
at
the
lowest
level
possible
given
their
subject
matter
It
sounds
and
appears
that
your
book
is
a
class
project
so
I
ll
also
put
it
in
Category
Class
projects
which
is
a
category
in
Category
Standard
curricula
which
is
a
category
in
Category
Books
by
subject
I
hadn
t
done
so
at
first
because
you
are
doing
well
in
designing
the
book
to
be
accessible
to
a
general
audience
as
opposed
to
students
at
any
particular
school
I
ve
only
categorized
a
few
other
class
projects
in
areas
other
than
class
projects
for
that
very
reason
so
you
should
take
pride
in
your
work

Great
work
and
a
huge
patience
Some
requests
for
consideration
Simplify
Computer
programming
and
others
like
Console
game
programming
into
the
same
category
Programming
Simplify
Computer
software
as
Software
move
open
source
as
a
sub
category
there
Simplify
Computer
science
and
Computer
engineering
as
Computing
this
can
be
tricky
but
will
simplify
overall
categorization
without
a
specific
loss
of
metadata
information
I
understand
that
it
attempts
to
classify
some
areas
as
scientific
but
the
classification
is
not
as
exact
when
dealing
in
computation
I
miss
the
Programming
category
for
instance
Algorithms
and
data
structure
or
Software
reverse
engineering
would
best
fit
there
The
clean
small
title
and
specific
languages
categories
is
also
very
much
missed
in
a
Programming

as
a
subcategory

Well
the
move
towards
longer
category
titles
makes
it
so
that
two
word
category
titles
that
are
sentence
case
will
avoid
conflicts
with
two
word
books
that
are
title
case
Merging
Computer
science
and
Computer
engineering
in
Computing
would
be
problematic
Right
now
Computing
is
a
top
level
category
so
that
would
cause
it
to
become
very
large
with
all
the
books
currently
in
those
two
categories
That
move
would
have
to
be
part
of
a
larger
reorganization
to
be
successful
You
can
find
programming
language
categories
in
Category
Programming
languages
by
family
And
the
longer
names
in
there
were
created
because
things
like
Cocoa
Java
and
Ruby
can
reference
things
other
than
programming
languages

this
revision
of
it
should
prove
that
it
was
actually
Darklama
who
initiated
the
move
to
Category
Computer
programming
and
Category
Computer
engineering
I
just
followed
through
to
make
that
happen
Darklama
s
area
of
expertise
is
computer
science
programming
and
has
made
several
changes
under
Computing
Even
if
Programming
would
be
better
than
Computer
programming
it
d
be
contrary
to
the
direction
Darklama
wanted
to
go
in
and
things
work
more
smoothly
when
we
work
together
I
am
certainly
open
to
suggestions
and
do
not
intend
for
anyone
to
think
the
current
organization
is
firm
but
since
Darklama
has
played
such
a
key
role
in
shaping
how
Computing
looks
today
he
needs
to
be
brought
in
on
this
discussion
before
any
massive
changes
can
be
made
I
see
from
both
your
user
pages
that
you
are
both
interested
in
computer
science
programming
so
I
think
discussions
would
more
fruitful
involving
you
two
primarily
I
ll
leave
him
a
note
asking
for
input
on
your
ideas
so
stay
tuned

Actually
Whiteknight
first
started
Computer
Engineering
in
2006
I
merely
moved
it
to
a
lowercase
name
to
be
consistent
with
other
subject
categories
I
don
t
think
the
categories
should
be
simplified
First
the
longer
names
can
reduce
the
possibility
of
conflicting
with
book
titles
Second
if
people
do
a
search
using
computer
they
can
find
the
engineering
programming
software
etc
categories
with
the
longer
names
but
not
with
the
shorter
names
Third
computer
science
and
computer
engineering
shouldn
t
be
merged
into
computing
because
there
distinctly
separate
fields
Fourth
if
you
look
at
Category
Computing
you
can
see
that
computer
science
computer
programming
and
computer
software
are
already
listed
as
related
categories
so
there
is
no
need
to
merge
the
categories
Software

engineering
right
now
is

computer

Software
engineering
Software
engineering
category
Algorithms
and
data
structure
are
in
a
related
category
link
to
from
the
computer
programming
category
I
thought
I
had
put
computer
engineering
into
computing
but
apparently
I
didn
t
that
is
one
change
I
can
make
to
improve
that
situation
Category
Computer
programming
languages
replaces
the
programming
languages
category
I
would
also
like
to
replace
the
console
game
programming
category
with
an
electronic
games
programming
category
to
compliment
Category
Electronic
games
which
brings
up
another
point
Fifth
programming
can
also
refer
to
television
programming
radio
programming
music
programming
and
other
sorts
of
programming
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
computers
Sixth
a
subject
page
can
be
created
to
list
books
from
the
many
categories
to
compensate
for
these
changes
while
combining
categories
would
result
in
a
loss
of
useful
information

Hi
Adrignola
If
I
were
to
nominate
you
for
admin
rights
would
you
accept
The
work
you
ve
done
here
has
clearly
demonstrated
your
thoughtfulness
attention
to
detail
and
general
knowledge
not
only
of
the
MediaWiki
software
but
also
of
how
the
Wikibooks
community
operates
Having
you
as
an
admin
here
would
do
nothing
but
enhance
this
project

I
am
pleased
that
you
think
so
highly
of
me
I
have
a
website
I
operate
for
an
open
source
game
being
developed
where
had
I
set
up
and
now
manage
the
MediaWiki
installation
there
so
I
had
a
certain
amount
of
knowledge
of
MediaWiki
before
I
started
becoming
active
here
However
that
site
is
quite
inactive
because
the
game
is
not
finished
yet
so
it
s
been
a
learning
experience
seeing
it
in
action
here
Wikibooks
does
feel
like
a
community
and
that
gave
me
the
inspiration
and
confidence
to
attempt
the
significant
categorization
effort
you
ve
no
doubt
noticed
I
can
t
think
of
any
reason
not
to
accept
so
yes
I
would
accept
I
hope
my
efforts
so
far
and
efforts
to
come
will
benefit
the
project
regardless
of
the
outcome

what
I

would

good

and

pages

with
some
changes

I
think
some
might
be
disappointed
that
featured
books
aren
t
shown
on
the
page
Recategorizing
would
be
more
difficult
Right
now
you
only
have
to
change
the
subject
and
category
of
the
same
name
This
layout
requires
you
to
change
all
the
parent
subjects
that
include
that
subject
you
re
recategorizing
on
the
same
page
as
the
books
filed
into
the
parent
subject
itself
Then
there
s
the
question
of
what
sub
subjects
get
top
billing
on
the
top
level
subject
page
For
instance
computer
science
isn
t
listed
on
the
page
for
Computing
And
what
if
someone
s
interested
in
computer
programming
libraries
but
sees
the
pages
listed
under
the
computer
programming
heading
and
thinks
that
s
all
there
is
when
libraries
are
actually
filed
in
a
subcategory
of
computer
programming
Those
are
constructive
criticisms
Some
things
I
especially
like
are
the
use
of
color
beyond
purple
and
the
elimination
of
collections
which
I
ve
yet
to
see
done
for
any
books
and
of
which
I
ve
yet
to
fully
grasp
the
use
of
I
wasn
t
involved
in
the
decision
to
move
to
subjects
so
I
don
t
know
if
there
were
any
additional
goals
beyond
the
dynamic
listing
of
books
in
a
subject
to
know
how
close
the
current
subjects
are
to
their
vision
I
do
believe
there
s
room
for
improvement
and
so
I
encourage
experimentation
since
creative
design
is
not
a
strong
point
of
mine

I
plan
to
include
featured
books
in
it
just
haven
t
yet
This
layout
is
only
intended
for
some
subject
pages
For
most
subject
pages
there
would
be
one
list
of
books
like
now
I
know
some
people
prefer
the
layout
of
the
Languages
bookshelf
over
the
Languages
subject
page
which
is
where
the
idea
of
using
multiple
book
listing
comes
into
play
for
some
subject
pages
Beyond
moving
toward
a
more
flexible
system
than
bookshelves
and
departments
there
aren
t
really
any
specific
community
goals
or
visions
for
the
subject
pages
Experimentation
is
suppose
to
be
fine
For
myself
I
prefer
to
think
of
the
subject
pages
as
a
web
rather
then
as
a
hierarchy
and
how
I
d
like
other
people
to
see
it
if
I
can
Which
is
part
of
why
I
replaced
Subtopics
with
Related
Subjects
at
one
point
in
Whiteknight
s
template
Another
part
of
that
goal
that
isn
t
apparent
from
my
subject
page
is
that
instead
of
using
back
links
subject
pages
like
Subject
Computing
would
also
be
categorized
in
each
of
its
related
categories
too
so
that
it
would
show
up
in
the
related
subjects
list
resulting
in
a
more
dynamic
two
way
link
between
subject
pages
that
requires
even
fewer
changes
to
update
Collections
are
intended
to
provide
an
easy
way
to
generate
PDF
files
for
books
so
might
eventually
replace
the
PDF
list
Collections
can
also
be
printed
and
generate
other
formats
so
they
might
also
eventually
replace
the
print
versions
books
have
as
well

Categorizing
pages
that
don
t
have
their
own
identities
There
are
three
pages
in
the
Conlang
book
that
are
effectively
sections
of
the
book
s
main
page
Each
of
them
manifests
as
part
of
the
main
page
and
can
be
edited
via
an
edit
button
in
that
part
of
the
main
page
mdash
and
each
of
them
should
not
be
edited
or
viewed
outside
of
that
context
I
deliberately
didn
t
categorize
them
because
I
didn
t
want
any
categories
pointing
to
these
inherently
non
independent
pages
As
part
of
your
heroic
efforts
at
cleaning
up
categorization
though
you
added
the
usual
book
category
code
to
each
of
them
Rather
than
knee
jerk
decategorizing
them
again
I
thought
I
d
check
with
you
first
Is
there
some
additional
factor
that
interferes
with
my
reason
for
not
categorizing
them

Having
a
category
on
them
prevents
them
from
showing
up
in
Special
UncategorizedPages
allowing
for
easier
viewing
of
new
books
pages
and
also
double
checking
to
make
sure
new
pages
weren
t
accidentally
created
as
standalone
instead
of
subpages
Could
we
put
the
pages
you
mention
in
say
Category
Conlang
Structural
or
your
choice
where
that
category
is
filed
in
Category
Conlang
and
holds
all
the
pages
that
are
structural
and
not
content
related
I

that
for

Using
Wikibooks
Hi
Adrignola
I
was
wondering
if
I
could
interest
you
in
writing
a
section
of
Using
Wikibooks
covering
subjects
and
categories
and
their
proper
use
It
could
answer
questions
like
What
s
the
difference
between
subjects
and
categories
What
subject
should
I
file
a
book
under
and
how
do
I
do
that
What
sort
of
subcategories
should
a
book
have
I
m
sure
you
can
think
of
other
aspects
that
elude
me
ATM
If
you
re
ambitious
you
could
even
help
us
catch
the
clue
train
about
DDC
and
LOC
My
thinking
is
that
the
better
people
understand
what
you
re
doing
and
what
the
logic
is
the
smaller
the
messes
they
will
make
and
the
better
off
the
project
will
be

A
quick
question
I
ran
across
something
I
thought
was
odd
and
I
thought
I
would
ask
you
what
to
think
about
it
Some
pages
I
ll
take
as
an
example
Functional
Analysis
Hilbert
spaces
place
themselves
in
the
Category
corresponding
to
the
book
by
having
a
tag
like
nowiki
subject
Functional
Analysis
Hilbert
spaces
nowiki
This
is
a
bit
different
then
things
I
have
usually
seen
and
I
was
curious
if
it
had
undesired
results
But
before
I
started
reading
the
template
to
figure
out
exactly
what
it
would
do
I
thought
I
would
ask
someone
a
bit
more
knowledgeable
then
myself

A
bot
could
parse
uses
of
the
subjects
template
on
subpages
for
its
own
purposes
making
there
use
on

a

of

Of
course
that
potential
benefit
is
a
personal

too

Categories
of
non
mainspace
pages
I
m
trying
to
suss
out
some
grand
scale
issues
in
arrangement
of
categories
of
non
mainspace
pages
most
of
this
I
ve
been
thinking
about
just
recently
with
regard
to
template
space
but
one
part
of
it
I
ve
also
been
mulling
over
for
some
time
with
regard
to
Wikijunior
I
do
apologize
for
springing
this
on
you
when
you
ve
already
got
more
than
enough
on
your
plate
already
but
it
seemed
like
a
good
idea
to
try
to
clear
these
broad
issues
out
of
the
way
sooner
rather
than
later
You
ll
recall
that
since
tl
BookCat
was
being
incidentally
applied
to
several
pages
in
my
Template
Navlist
suite
anyway
I
categorized
all
of
them
by
simply
adding
tl
BookCat
to
the
rest
and
creating
Category
Template
Navlist
I
had
initially
worried
that
it
would
seem
anomalous
to
have
a
category
whose
name
begins
with
tt
Template
tt
but
in
the
event
it
seems
to
me
to
work
out
well
because
when
you
look
at
nowrap
Category
Navigational
templates
this
way
everything
belonging
to
it
starts
with
tt
Template
tt
mdash
both
member
category
and
member
pages
Now
the
vast
majority
I
think
of
template
space
pages
are
actually
specific
to
particular
books
and
in
your
Using
Wikibooks
write
up
you
ve
recommended
putting
such
templates
in
a
subcategory
of
the
book
category
called
nbsp
tt
Category
My
Book
Templates
tt
But
logically
should
all
pages
in
template
space
be
somewhere
under
Category
Templates
Because
if
they
should
then
these
template
subcategories
of
book
categories
should
have
a
place
in
the
hierarchy
depending
from
tt
Category
Templates
tt
And
if
not
then
tt
Category
Templates
tt
should
probably
be
called
something
else
like
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category
Generic
templates
tt
A
side
problem
at
this
point
is
where
in
the
hierarchy
to
put
them
that
won
t
swamp
the
existing
categories
of
generic
templates
For
example
there
are
probably
a
lot
of
book
specific
navbox
templates
but
putting
them
directly
in
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category
Navigational
templates
tt
nbsp
would
make
the
generics
hard
to
find
Perhaps
one
could
just
throw
all
the
subcategories
of
book
categories
into
a
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category
Book
specific
templates
tt
If
more
precision
is
needed
one
could
also
have
subcategories
like
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category
Book
specific
navigational
templates
tt
though
that
seems
liable
to
get
out
of
hand
There
seems
to
be
at
least
some
merit
though
to
giving
these
book
specific
categories
names
starting
with
tt
Template
tt
thus
nbsp
tt
Category
Template
My
Book
tt
nbsp
rather
than
nbsp
tt
Category
My
Book
Templates
tt
Besides
the
straightforwardness
of
prefixing
space
specific
category
names
with
the
name
prefix
of
the
space
this
also
means
that
if
the
book
specific
templates
for
nowrap
tt
My
Book
tt
are
given
names
of
the
form
nowrap
tt
Template
My
Book
Some
template
tt
then
generic
categorization
techniques
such
as
tl
BookCat
could
be
used
Were
we
to
go
with
the
tt
Category
Template
tt
form
we
d
want
to
recommend
the
nowrap
tt
Template
My
Book
Some
template
tt
form
I
might
actually
have
seen
a
semi
recommendation
of
that
naming
scheme
somewhere
or
other
A
similar
situation
exists
with
Wikijunior
pages
the
book
categories
there
that
I
ve
seen
always
have
to
be
written
out
manually
because
they
are
prefixed
with
tt
Wikijunior
tt
rather
than
tt
Wikijunior
tt
e
g
nowrap
Category
Wikijunior
The
Elements
rather
than
nowrap
Category
Wikijunior
The
Elements
so
that
techniques
like
tl
BookCat
cannot
be
used
Looking
over
all
that
there
seem
to
be
three
distinct
possibilities
raised
Put
book
specific
templates
in
a
catch
all
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category
Book
specific
templates
tt
Give
template
subcategories
of
book

I
noticed
that
with
Wikijunior
Historically
the
categories
matched
the
books
names
mdash
they
were
moved
to
the
Wikijunior
namespace
later
when
it
was
created
I
d
have
to
recategorize
all
the
Wikijunior
pages
to
correct
that
though
it
wouldn
t
be
any
more
work
than
categorizing
an
uncategorized
page
I
would
agree
with
the
effort
to
create
new
Wikijunior
categories
and
correct
their
books
pages
categories
I
would
prefer
book
specific
templates
be
filed
in
their
book
s
category
regardless
of
what
the
name
of
their
container
category
is
The
generic
category
would
get
too
cluttered
otherwise
Supporting
the
above
I
would
agree
that
Category
Templates
needs
to
have
a
name
change
Wikipedia
has
w
Category
Wikipedia
templates
so
the
top
level
category
for
generic
templates
on
Wikibooks
can
be
Category
Wikibooks
templates
It
s
blue
because
it
s
a
redirect
to
Category
Templates
That
should
be
reversed
I
do
agree
that
using
the
form
tt
Template
My
Book
Template
Blah
tt
would
enable
easier
categorizing
using
tlx
BookCat
The
container
category
would
be
tt
Category
Template
My
Book
tt
yes
You
d
have
to
manually
specify
your
book
s
category
when
filing
your
template
category
still
That
would
differ
from
using
tt
Category
My
Book
Templates
tt
where
you
have
to
manually
specify
the
category
on
the
templates
and
the
template
category
I
happen
to
like
the
look
of
tt
Category
My
Book
Templates
tt
though
but
since
it
s
something
unique
to
each
book
authors
can
use
whatever
they
feel
is
best

I
agree
the
Wikijunior
categories
should
be
renamed
to
Category
Wikijunior
Book
I
also
don
t
like
a
catch
all
category
for
all
book
specific
templates
Keeping
track
of
templates
would
become
more
difficult
Personally
I
think
a
lot
of
book
specific
templates
don
t
need
to
be
book
specific
I
think
the
only
templates
that
need
to
be
book
specific
are
templates
that
provide
navigation
between
pages
and
even
that
isn
t
really
necessary
for
books
that
only
care
to
have
back
forward
and
table
of
content
links
Books
are
required
by
policy
to
use
the
tt
Book
Page
tt
form
for
any
pages
of
the
book
and
I
think
sticking
with
that
form
for
any
templates
and
categories
for
the
book
creates
consistency
and
is
a
good
idea
Other
forms
have
been
discussed
in
the
past
on
the
talk
pages
for
Naming
convention
Hierarchy
and
Naming
policy
and
rejected
by

Okay
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category

tt

was
a
daft
idea
it
would
serve
no
useful
organizational
purpose
Renaming
nbsp
tt

tt
nbsp
appeals
to
me
I
agree
actually
about
the
look
uniformity
of
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category
My

tt
Also
because
we
are
only
filing
this
category
under
the
book
category
and
not
at
all
under
the
nbsp
tt
Category
Templates
tt
nbsp
hierarchy
mnemonic
sense
is
all
for
prefixing
the
category
name
with
the
book
name
rather
than
with
nbsp
tt
Template
tt
It
occurs
to
me
that
if
the
templates
are
called
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Template
My
Book
Template
Blah
tt
one
could
exploit
that
naming
scheme
with
a
template
alternative
to
nbsp
tt
Template
BookCat
tt
call
it
nbsp
tt
Template
BookTemplateCat
tt
that
would

add
nbsp

tt
Template
My

Template
Blah
tt
nbsp
to

nowrap
tt
Category
My

tt
I
too
think
that
most
book
specific
templates
don
t
have
to
be
book
specific
but
categorizing
what
we
already
have
seems
both
simpler
than
and
a
facilitator
to
thoughtfully
reforming
detailed
template
tactics
across
the
whole
of
Wikibooks
Sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
colossal
task
thereof

As
I
understand
it
Category
Templates
is
whatever
one
calls
it
the
common
ancestor
of
all
non
book
specific
categories
of
templates
It
isn
t
the
root
category
of
all
templates
because
some
book
specific
templates
will
not
belong
to
it
or
any
descendant
of
it
It
isn
t
a
category
only
of
generic
templates
because
some
book
specific
templates
will
belong
to
various
subcategories
of
it
such
as
Category
Exclude

Not
that
its
likely
to
make
a
difference
but
I
meant
common
ancestor
for
all
templates
and
template
categories
Some
book
specific
templates
will
be
listed
somewhere
within
Category
Templates
because
they
are

by
other

Under
the
current
plan
there
will
be
both
templates
and
categories
of
templates
that
are
not
descended
in
any
degree
from
nbsp
tt
Category
Templates
tt
This
is
because
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Template
My

Template

tt
nbsp
might
belong
directly
only
to

tt
Category
My

tt
which
in
turn
belongs
directly
only
to
nbsp

tt
Category
My

tt
which
is
not
a

of
nbsp
tt
Category

tt
It
would
be
different
if
we
also
filed
each

tt

in
a

but
unless
we
do
that
some
templates
and
categories
of
templates
will
not
be
descended
from
nbsp
tt

tt
Indeed
I
m
now
thinking
I
was
too
hasty
in
withdrawing
my
proposal

tt
Category

tt
It
would
perform
two

nbsp
2
nbsp
causing

tt

tt
nbsp
to
be
indeed
the

top

of
all

Function
nbsp
1
would
be
especially
useful
because
systematically
identifying
all
book

would
make
them
easy
to
target
in

is
the

talking

nowiki
tt
These
may
not
be
the
ideal
names
for
the
two
categorizing
templates
after
all
It
would
also
be
possible
for
book
specific
templates
that
don
t
conform
to
the
naming
convention
to
manually
put
themselves
into
the
appropriate
category
ies
Wikijunior
book
specific
templates
would
probably
always
be
non
conformant
I
don
t
see
any
natural
way
to
extend
the
book
specific
template
naming
convention
to
cover
Wikijunior
Under
this
arrangement
Every
book
specific
template
would
belong
either
directly
to
its
book
category
or
to
a
child
of
its
book
category
This
is
just
as
in
the
flat
and
deep
filing
arrangements
you
recommended
in
Using
Wikibooks
so
I
assume
that
this
would
be
fine
when
renaming
a
book
Every
book
specific
template
would
belong
either
directly
to
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category
Book
specific
templates
tt
or
to
a
child
of
that
category
This
would
not
clutter
the
pre
existing
categories
of
templates
because
all
the
book
specific
templates
and
book
specific
template
categories
would
be
tucked
away
under
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Category
Book
specific

tt
the
only
effect
on
nbsp
tt
Category

tt
nbsp
would
be
the
addition

I
am
inclined
I
find
that
if
an
author
has
made
one
template
or
uploaded
one
image
they
ll
likely
make
upload
more
Also
it
s
easier
to
explain

in

than
to

try
to
deal
with
things
like
how

have
before

It
is
a
great
idea
for
Wikibooks
Go
team
It
does
make
a
mess
out
of
my
categorization
of
the
Template
Navlist
suite
whose
book
category
should
not
be
called
Category
Navlist
Templates
since
it
is
not
a
category
of
book
specific
templates
for
a
book
called
nbsp
tt

tt
I
tried
hoping
against

creating

from
Category
Navlist
Templates
to
Category
Template
Navlist
but
the
member
pages
are
left
behind
in
the
category
with
the
wrong
name
I
suppose
I
ll
probably
create
a
special
template
just
for
use
by
the
suite
that
checks
to
see
whether
the
client
page
has

does

Undefined
FULLCHAPTERNAME
variable
There
are
two
problems
I
see
with
your
placement
of
chapter
names
as
part
of
the
category
system
and
that
is
for
most
of
these
older
books
FULLCHAPTERNAME
is
not
defined
and
also
the
way
you
are
using
the
category
command
is
not
the
way
it
wants
to
be
used
The
Category
command
does
not
take
two
fields
the
way
it
is
written
so
that
even
if
you
did
have
a
valid
variable
it
would
not
result
in
a
change
in
the
category
The
way
I
have
managed
to
get
chapter
to
work
is
to
put
it
after
a
nowiki
nowiki
character
then
you
get
nowiki
Bookname
Chaptername
nowiki
as
its
category
I
hope
this
helps

its

What

you

the
following
changes

When

tt
the

This
is
what
got
me
started
thinking
about

I
saw
how

sorted

When

a

in
it
but
is
not

form
nbsp
nowrap
tt
nowiki
Category
FULLBOOKNAME

nowiki
tt
would
put
that
category
into
the
category
named
by
removing
the
last
part
of
the

from
the
last

on
Thus
nbsp

tt
I
considered
adding

nbsp
nowrap
tt
nowiki
filing
deep
nowiki
tt
nbsp
option
but
wasn
t
sure
whether
it
would
be
worth
it
Presumably
it
would
change
the
behavior
everywhere
except
in
category
space
where
there
might
be
a

tt

filing

nowiki
tt

When
called

do
nothing
hence
no
harm
I
ve
set
up

these
changes

belong

it

Goodbook
Not
without
trepidation
beside
the
sensitivity
of
tl

itself
I
m
paranoid
about
my

absent

The
change
could
be
modified
to
automatically
add
them
to

as
well
or
instead
if
the

No
you
want
it
in
the
true
evaluation
so
that
it
will
apply
just
to
those
pages
that
transclude
tl
Goodbook

additionally
have
names
that
start
with
tt
Template
Goodbook
tt
That
s
Goodbook
itself
and
all

Otherwise
it
wouldn
t
categorize
any
of
those
pages
but
it
would
put
for
example
the
Main
Page
into
the
Goodbook
category
since
tl
Goodbook
does
get
transcluded
there
which
is
why
tl

why
you
couldn

that

Question
but
at
least
it
s
a
well
defined
one
this
time
When
naming
a
book
specific
template
associated
with
a
Wikijunior
book
it
would
be
messy
to
call
it
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Template
Wikijunior
My
Book
Blah
tt
because
then
you
d
always
have
to
include
the
nbsp
tt
Template
tt
nbsp
prefix
when
calling
it
i
e
nowrap
tt
nowiki
Template
Wikijunior
My
Book
Blah
nowiki
tt
nbsp
rather
than
nbsp
nowrap
tt
nowiki
Wikijunior
My
Book
Blah
nowiki
tt
nbsp
because
the
latter
looks
in
Wikijunior
space
instead
of
template
space
Should
we
perhaps
use
a
slash
in
place
of
the
internal
colon
thus
nbsp
nowrap
tt
Template
Wikijunior
My
Book
Blah
tt
nbsp
This
could
be
detected
and
compensated
for
by
tl
BookCat
If
we
do
that
we
might
also
want
to
apply
the
same
transformation
to
the
category
names
more
work
for
tl
BookCat
That
is

ROOTBOOKNAME
I

tl
ROOTBOOKNAME
I
suggest
tl
BookTemplate
should
use
ROOTBOOKNAME
instead
of
FULLBOOKNAME
in
both
the

and
the

This
would
allow
BookTemplate
to
work
right
when

that

it
and
when
using
those
book
templates
on

and
when
using
it
to
call

from

pages
It
could
also
be
used
in

book
and
book
template
categories
as
in
tt
nowiki
This
category
contains
templates
used
in

I
m
not

there
isn

a
better
name
than
ROOTBOOKNAME
that
I
m

of
I
don
t
think
there
are
any
other
cases

Limitations
of
BookTemplate
Although
I
do
think
tl
ROOTBOOKNAME
is
primordial
enough
that
it
s
The
Right
Thing
this
might
not
be
true
of
tl
BookTemplate
Maybe
it
isn
t
actually
the
Wrong
Thing
but
it
may
be
only
a
tool
for
the
majority
of
light
applications
with
a
second
heavy
duty
tool
needed
for
special
occasions
In
field
testing
on
the
seriously
stressful
case
of
False
Friends
of
the
Slavist
I
m
now
looking
at
a
book
specific
template
with
171
unnamed
parameters
and
9
named
parameters
tl
False
Friends
of
the
Slavist
MapConstructor
That
deserves
some
careful
thought
before
acting
Here
s
an
idea
I
m
mulling
over
a
higher
order
template
that
generates
as
output
the
name
of
a
book
template
i
e
nowrap
tt
nowiki
includeonly
Template
ROOTBOOKNAME
includeonly
nowiki
tt
For
example
if
its
name
were
nbsp
tt
bt
tt
one
would
write
nbsp
tt
nowiki
bt
MapConstructor
nowiki
tt
Choosing
a
name
for
this
device
is
something
of
a
challenge
it
should
probably
have
a
very
short
name
at
worst
no
longer
than
BookTemplate
and
it
may
want
to
avoid
having
meta
in
its
name
lest
that
been
confused
with
m
Meta
I
m
even
half
tempted
by
nbsp

my
basic
agreement
with

Yes
that
book
you
re

with
is
quite
the
challenge
I
understand
what
your
higher
order
template
would
do
yet
I
don

see
what
its
goal
is
What
would
its
advantage
be
over
the
code
currently
in

BookTemplate
I
wouldn
t
want
to
make
things
too
complicated
for
the
people
who
have
to

these

Using
tl

the
only
parameters
that
will
reach
the
target
in
this
case
nowrap
nowiki
ROOTBOOKNAME
MapConstructor
nowiki
are
those

that

There

no

in

upping
the

of

there
are
still
named
parameters
that
don

get

the
only
way
to

be

I
ve
created
a
template
tl
BOOKTEMPLATE
that
simply
generates
the
main
book
template
name
for
the
current
book
i
e
nowrap
tt
nowiki
Template
ROOTBOOKNAME
nowiki
tt
My
notion
is
that
an
editor
reading
markup
sees
the
all
caps
and
expects
a
device
that
generates
part
of
a
page
name
because
that
s
what
all
the
other
all
caps
names
do
pre
existing
naming
convention
The
notation
for
calling
the
main
book
template
of
a
book
would
then
be
nowrap

nowiki
BOOKTEMPLATE
one
two
what

Another
reason
to
noinclude
BookCat
You
asked
a
while
back
over
on
my
talk
page
about
removing
the
noincludes
around
tl
BookCat
My
answer
has
changed
a
bit
I
now
recommend
noincluding
BookCat
for
pretty
much
every
template
that
doesn
t
generate
a
complete
table
The
reason
is
that
as
I
was
gradually
forced
to
remember
by
wrestling
with
Template
False
Friends
of
the
Slavist
MapLegend4
category
links
have
a
tendency
to
prevent
paragraph
breaks
though
I
don
t
remember
exactly
how
that
works
if
I
ever
really
understood
it

I
think
that
s
a
bad
idea
Using
noinclude
defeats
the
main
reason
why
its
usually
included
to
begin
with
To
make
it
easy
to
categorize
pages
of
a
book
without
having
to
manually
categorize
each
page
separately
I
think
having
templates
with
the
only
difference
being
the
number
of
arguments
passed
are
bad
ideas
too
so
I
went
and
fixed
that
I
think
the
MapConstructor
template
needs
improved
too
because
all
the
images
overlap
each
other
based
on
the
positioning
making
any
obscured
images
loaded
a
waste
of
bandwidth
and
slows
down
the
time
it
takes
to
load

I
did
notice
your
technical
fix
for
the
problem
with
MapLegend
Admitting
such
technical
fixes
on
a
case
by
case
basis
somewhat
expands
the
range
of
templates
that
can
include
BookCat
Recalling
a
key
element
from
the
earlier
discussion
though
BookCat
neessarily
must
be
noincluded
on
templates
that
could
be
used
inside
links
which
is
most
of
the
templates
for
Friends
of
the
Slavist
mdash
and
also
the
Navlist
files
used
to
specify
book
contents
as
we
were
forcibly
reminded
when
adding
included
category
markup
to
Conlang
Navlist
broke
all
the
navbox
links
in
the
Conlang
book
Likewise
BookCat
must
be
noincluded
on
templates
that
generate
fragments
of
template
names
As
a
rule
of
thumb
I
d
still
noinclude
BookCat
on
any
template
that
generates
a
small
text
fragment
without
embedded
markup

This
is
another
plant
easily
confused
with
the
Taraxacum
officinale
Dandelion
The
easiest
way
to
tell
the
difference
is
by
looking
at
its
leaves
The
edges
do
not
have
any
lobes
or
indentations
and
the
surface
of
the
leaf
is
covered
with
hair
It
does
not
grow
as
tall
as
Hieracium
pratense
Yellow
Hawkweed
and
it
has
only
one
flower
at
the
top
of
the
stem
In
fact
the
whole
plant
with
the
exception
of
the
flower
parts
is
covered
in
hairs
usually
whitish
but
sometimes
reddish
on
the
stem
This
is
another
plant
that
grows
in
waste
places
such
as
along
roadsides
and
railroad
tracks
It
thrives
in
dry
infertile
soil
facts
People
once
believed
that
any
blade
covered
in
this
plant
s
juices
would
be
able
to
cut
through
stone
as
easily
as
through

except
that
the
flower
is
bright
orange
and
it

Because
of
its
bright
orange
color
Orange

sometimes
called
The

Orange
Hawkweed
is
a
low

growing
around
the
base
of

and
one
or
more

facts
Orange
Hawkweed
is
not
native
to
North
America
but
was
brought
here
to
grow
in
flower
beds
It
has
since
escaped
from
gardens
and
now
grows
wild
in
many
places
In
New

and
Tasmania
it
grows
so
well
that
it
crowds
out
native
species
and
those

have
banned
it

Common
Yellow
Woodsorrel
is
a
plant
commonly
confused
with
clover
It
has
pretty
little
yellow
flowers
with
five
petals
The
leaves
grow
in
threes
and
are
shaped
like
hearts
When
the
plant
is
young
the
stems
stand
up
and
hold
the
leaves
and
flowers
high
As
the
summer
wears
on
though
the
stems
lay
down
and
the
plant
creeps
along
on
the
ground
In
the
daytime
the
leaves
open
wide
to
catch
the
sun
but
at
night
the
plant
folds
them
up

Iterated
Function
Systems
or
IFS
is
the
name
given
to
a
method
for
calculating
fractals
based
on
a
number
of
contractive
affine
transformations
Researchers
Michael
Barnsley
did
a
lot
of
work
on
this
type
of
fractal
including
naming
it
Australian
mathematician
John
Hutchinson
who
called
the
system
a
Multiple
Reduction
Copy
Machine
or
MRCM
also
contributed
to
the
field
The
Basic
Method
There
are
quite
a
few
variations
on
this
method
but
the
basic
idea
is
still
the
same
Define
a
number
of
contractive
affine
transformations
in
the
unit
square
these
are
also
known
as
Hutchinson
Operators
Insert
points
at
random
positions
into
the
unit
square
or
another
initializing
region
of
R2
Make
a
random
selection
from
the
list
of
transformations
and
apply
it
to
the
point
After
some
run
up
number
of
iterations
begin
drawing
the
points
into
an
accumulation
buffer
Continue
inserting
points
until
the
desired
coverage
or
quality
is
achieved
The
accumulated
values
will
usually
need
a
log
transform
to
bring
them
into
good
viewing
range
Sorting
the
positions
of
and
resampling
the
points
into
an
image
using
a
filter
kernel
can
give
a
better
resulting
image
but
is
a
lot
more
costly
in
terms
of
memory
and
computation
Affine
Transformations
Affine
transforms
are
a
geometrical
construct
that
comprises
translation
rotation
scaling
and
shear
in
2
or
more
dimensions
A
2
dimensional
affine
transform
can
be
conveniently
stored
in
a
3x3
matrix
for
the
transformation
of
homogeneous
2D
points
These
transforms
are
applied
by
simply
multiplying
the
point
s
position
by
the
matrix

Image
Processing
One
major
technical
tool
to
understand
is
the
way
a
computer
handles
images
We
have
to
know
how
we
can
edit
images
and
what
techniques
we
have
to
rearrange
images
Image
Representation
Grayscale
For
a
computer
an
image
is
nothing
more
than
a
huge
amount
of
little
squares
These
squares
are
called
pixel
In
a
grayscale
image
each
of
this
pixel
carries
a
number
n
often
it
holds
math
0
leq
n
leq
255
math
This
number
n
represents
the
exactly
color
of
this
square
in
the
image
This
means
in
a
grayscale
image
we
can
use
256
different
grayscales
where
255
means
a
white
spot
and
0
means
the
square
is
black
To
be
honest
we
could
even
use
more
than
256
different
levels
of
gray
In
the
mentioned
way
every
pixels
uses
exactly
1
byte
or
8
bit
of
memory
to
be
saved
Due
to
the
binary
system
of
a
computer
it
holds
2
sup
8
sup
256
If
you
think
it
is
necessary
to
have
more
different
gray
scales
in
your
image
this
is
not
a
problem
You
just
can
use
more
memory
to
save
the
picture
But
just
remember
this
could
be
a
hard
task
for
huge
images
Further
quite
often
you
have
the
problem
that
your
sensing
device
e
g
your
monitor
can
not
show
more
than
this
256
different
gray
colors
Colour
Representing
a
colourful
image
is
only
slightly
more
complicated
than
the
grayscale
picture
All
you
have
to
know
is
that
the
computer
works
with
a
additive
colour
mixture
of
the
three
main
colors
Red
Green
and
Blue
This
are
the
so
called
RGB
colours
Also
these
images
are
saved
by
pixels
But
now
every
pixel
has
to
know
3
values
between
0
and
256
for
every
Color
1
value
So
know
we
have
256
sup
3
sup
16
777
216
different
colours
which
can
be
represented
Similar
to
the
grayscale
images
also
here
holds
that
no
color
means
black
and
having
all
color
means
white
That
means
the
colour
0
0
0
is
black
whereas
0
0
255
means
blue
and
255
255
255
is
white

Filtering
1D
Filter
In
many
technical
applications
we
find
some
primitive
basis
in
which
we
easily
can
describe
features
In
1
dimensional
cases
filters
are
not
a
big
deal
therefore
we
can
use
this
filters
for
changing
images
The
so
called
Savitzky
Golay
Filter
allows
to
smooth
incoming
signals
The
filter
was
described
in
1964
by
Abraham
Savitzky
and
Marcel
J
E
Golay
It
is
a
impulse
respond
filter
IR
For
better
understanding
lets
look
at
a
example
In
1d
we
usually
deal
with
vectors
One
such
given
vector
we
call
x
and
it
holds
math
mathbf
x
x
1
x
2
dots
x
n
with
n
in
mathbb
N
math
Our
purpose
is
to
smooth
that
vector
x
To
do
so
all
we
need
is
another
vector
math
mathbf
w
w
1
w
2
dots
w
m
with
n
m
in
mathbb
N
math
this
vector
we
call
a
weight
vector
With
math
y
k
displaystyle
sum
i
1
m
w
i
x
k
m
i
math
we
now
have
a
smoothed
vector
y
This
vector
is
smoother
than
the
vector
before
because
we
only
save
the
average
over
a
few
entries
in
the
vector
These
means
the
newly
found
vectorentries
depends
on
some
entries
right
left
and
right
of
the
entry
to
smooth
One
major
drawback
of
this
approach
is
the
newly
found
vector
y
only
has
n
m
entries
instead
of
n
as
the
original
vector
x
Drawing
this
new
vector
would
lead
to
the
same
function
as
before
just
with
less
amplitude
So
no
data
is
lost
but
we
have
less
fluctuation
2D
Filter
Going
from
the
1d
case
to
the
2d
case
is
done
by
simply
make
out
of
vectors
matrices
As
already
mentioned
a
gray
level
image
is
for
a
computer
or
for
a
softwaretool
as
MATLAB
nothing
more
than
a
huge
matrix
filled
with
natural
numbers
often
between
0
and
255
The
weight
vector
is
now
a
weight
matrix
But
still
we
use
the
filter
by
adding
up
different
matrix

Dilation

For
linear

as
seen
before
it
holds
that
they
are

In
other
words
it
does
not
matter
how
many
and
in
which
sequence
different
linear
filters
you
use
E
g
if
a
Savitzky
Golay
filter
is
applied
to
some
date
and
then
a
second
Savitzky
Golay
filter
for
calculationg
the
first
derivative
the
result
is
the
same
if
the
sequence
of
filters
is
reversed
It
even
holds
that
there
would
have
been
one
filter
which
does
the
same
as
the
two
applied
In
contrast
morphological
operations
on
an
image
are
non
linear
operations
and
the
final
result
depends
on
the
sequence
If
we
think
of
any
image
it
is
defined
by
pixels
with
values
x
sub
ij
sub
Further
this
image
is
assumed
to
be
a
black
and
white
image
so
we
have
math
x
ij
0
or
1
forall
i
j
math
To
define
a
morphological
operation
we
have
to
set
a
structural
element
SE
As
example
a
3x3
Matrix
as
a
part
of
the
image
The

So
in
words
if
any
of
the
pixels
in
the
structural
element
M
has
value
0
the
erosion
sets
the
value
of
M
a
specific
pixel
in
M
to
zero
Otherwise
E

And
for
the

it

if
any

the

I
asked
regarding
the
deletion
of
A
Textbook
on
Recovery
Psychology
if
the
content
taken
from
Psychiatric
Rehabilitation
and
Recovery
could
be
rolled
back
since
Psychiatric
Rehabilitation
is
an
already
existing
subject
the
answer
I
got
was
not
very
clear
The
field
of
Psychiatric
Rehabilitation
Psychosocial
Rehabilitation
is
actual
a
sub
category
of
social
work
or
behavioral
health
or
rehabilitation
I
felt
it
would
fit
in
recovery
psychology
as
much
as
the
social
work
content
which
is
90
of
a
psychology
of
developmental
disability
textbooks
As
a
critic
of
textbooks
I
find
that
the
psychology
part
of
such
textbooks
psychology
of
developmental
disability
or
that
10
is
not
really
psychology
but
humanistic
philosophy
history
politics
and
the
statements
which
declare
what
the
word
disability
means
The
material
in
this
text
Psychiatric
Rehabilitation
and
Recovery
was
absolutely
boring
and
dull
but
factual
It
was
the
one
thing
I
can
assert
I
am
credentialed
in
if
you
even
care
about
expertise
If
we
were
to
discuss
expertise
It
would
be
far
more
redeemable
by
the
standards
that

Polystim
neurotechnologies
Laboratory
at
the
Ecole
Polytechnique
de
Montreal
has
been
working
on
a
visual
prosthesis
to
be
implanted
into
the
human
cortex
The
basic
principle
of
Dr
Sawan
s
technology
consists
in
stimulating
the
visual
cortex
by
implanting
a
silicium
microchip
on
a
network
of
electrodes
made
of
biocompatible
materials
and
in
which
each
electrode
injects
a
stimulating
electrical
current
in
order
to
provoke
a
series
of
luminous
points
to
appear
an
array
of
pixels
in
the
field
of
vision
of
the
sightless
person
This
system
is
composed
of
two
distinct
parts
the
implant
and
an
external
controller
The
implant
lodged
in
the
visual
cortex
wirelessly
receives
dedicated
data
and
energy
from
the
external
controller
This
implantable
part
contains
all
the
circuits
necessary
to
generate
the
electrical
stimuli
and
to
oversee
the
changing
microelectrode
biological
tissue
interface
On
the
other
hand
the
battery
operated
outer
control
comprises
a
micro
camera
which
captures
the
image
as
well
as
a
processor
and
a
command
generator
which
process
the
imaging
data
to
select
and
translate
the
captured
images
and
to
generate
and
manage
the
electrical
stimulation
process
and
oversee
the
implant
The
external
controller
and
the
implant
exchange
data
in
both
directions
by
a
powerful
transcutaneous
radio
frequency
RF
link
The
implant
is
powered
the
same
way

Buttercups
are
a
bright
yellow
flower
with
five
petals
The
flowers
usually
grow
at
the
top
of
a
long
stem
The
leaf
shape
depends
on
the
species
but
they
usually
have
wavy
edges
that
zig
and
zag
deeply
back
and
forth
There
are
nearly
a
hundred
species
of
Buttercups
growing
in
the
United
States
and
four
hundred
species
world
wide
All
Buttercups
are
poisonous
when
eaten
fresh
by
cattle
horses
and
other
livestock
but
their
acrid
taste
and
the
blistering
of
the
mouth
caused
by
their
poison
means
they
are
usually
left
uneaten
facts
In
Pacific
Northwest
of
the
United
States
the
buttercup
is
called
Coyote
s
eyes
In
the
the
Nez
Perce
Indian
legend
Coyote
was
tossing
his
eyes
up
in
the
air
and
catching
them
again
when
Eagle
snatched
them
Unable
to
see
Coyote
made
eyes
from
the
buttercup

on
it
If
you
pluck
a
leaf
and
hold
it
up
to
the
light
you
should
be
able
to
see
them
The
dots
around
the
edges
sometimes
turn
black
The
scientific
name
Hypericum
means
over
picture
because
people
used
to
pick
the
plant
and
hang
it
over
the
picture
of
a
saint
to
ward
off
evil
The
other
part
of
its
name
perfoliatum
means
leaf
with
holes
remember
that
the
holes
along
the
edge
of
a
piece
of
paper
are
called
perforations
and
leaves
are
also
called

If

Welcome
to
my
page
I
am
now
trying
to
build
up
the
C
Sharp
Programming
The
NET
Framework
Windows
Forms
Windows
Forms
section
of
the
C
programming
book
Generally
I
love
the
topic
of
Windows
programming
and
hope
to
contribute
to
writing
some
brilliant
prose
on
the
matter
In
the
future
I
also
hope
to
expand
on
the
manuals
for
PHP
and
ASP
net
but
unfortunately
I
know
a
lot
less
about
them
BTW
imho
it
s
a
pity
that
even
for
widely
known
programming
environments
the
level
of
editor
enthusiasm
and
consequently
the
amount
of
work
done
is
a
lot
smaller
than
what
is
found
in
the
mainstream
Wikipedia
It
sure
would
have
helped
if
some
of
the
sort
of
passion
that
went
into
documenting
w
Atlas
Shrugged
and
w
Star
Trek
could
have
also
contributed
to
documenting
popular
programming
frameworks

Most
strains
of
bees
are
super
hard
working
but
they
are
also
sensible
and
will
take
their
food
from
easier
sources
than
they
usually
favour
if
it
is
up
to
standard
This
includes
some
forms
of
human
food
and
sometimes
brings
them
into
conflict
with
us
But
some
bees
take
this
alternative
food
source
thing
to
extremes
and
even
rob
food
i
e
honey
and
pollen
etc
from
neighbouring
hives
These
hives
will
usually
defend
their
stocks
vigorously
but
not
always
successfully
It
has
also
been
noted
that
the
different
species
of
honey
bees
differ
greatly
in
their
tendencies
to
rob
and
their
ability
to
defend
the

NOTOC
Here
are
tips
for
cooking
a
good
steak
Cuts
The
tenderest
cuts
come
from
the
short
loin
and
rib
primal
Good
steaks
to
start
out
with
are
strip
steaks
top
sirloins
T
bones
Porterhouses
and
ribeyes
Tenderloin
cuts
are
pretty
tender
but
if
you
overcook
them
they
can
be
dry
Seasoning
Keep
it
simple
I
like
just
salt
and
pepper
or
a
nice
rub
but
you
can
use
anything
that
won
t
overpower
the
meat
Rub
the
steak
with
a
little
olive
oil
and
sprinkle
on
your
seasoning
Cooking
Grilling
broiling
and
pan
roasting
are
classics
but
feel
free
to
use
any
dry
heat
method
you
want
such
as
sauteing
Also
at
at
least
one
point
you
ll
want
to
use
enough
heat
to
brown
it
That
makes
all
the
difference
Slicing
Ever
just
sliced
a
steak
as
is
and
it
turns
out
to
be
so
tough
you
can
t
eat
it
I
admit
that
this
has
happened
to
me
But
now
I
know
how
to
keep
this
from
happening
You
know
those
lines
on
the
meat
Slicing
as
thin
as
you
can
at
a
45
degree
angle
will
keep
those
short
which
will
mean
tenderness
The
only
exceptions
are
tenderloin
which
is
so
tender
already
and
cuts
from
the
flank
like
skirt
and
flank
which
have
a
different
grain
structure
Marinating
Marinating
can
do
a
lot
of
things
but
I
ll
tell
you
what
it
won
t
do
It
won
t
tenderize
Commercial
tenderizers
use
enzymes
like
papain
not
acids
Okay
we
got
that
over
with
Now
when
you
pick
a
steak
for
marination
pick
a
steak
with
high
surface
to
mass
ratio
like
inside
skirt
Try
to
balance
your
marinade
with
salt
acidity
spicy
herby
if
that
s
a
word
and
flavor
You
re
probably
thinking
What
s
the
difference
between
a
brine
and
a
marinade
One
of
the
differences
is
that
most
marinades
contain
acids
and
not
the
huge
amounts
of
salt
like
in
a
brine
I
hope
you
learned
a
lot
about
good
steak

Matrix
Algebra
If
you
want
to
create
a
new
matrix
one
way
is
to
use
the
tt
matrix
tt
function
You
have
to
enter
a
vector
of
data
the
number
of
rows
and
or
columns
and
finally
you
can
specify
if
you
want
R
to
read
your
vector
by
row
or
by
column
the
default
option
with
tt
byrow
tt
You
can
also
combine
vectors
using
tt
cbind
tt
or
tt
rbind
tt
The
dimension
of
a
matrix
can
be
obtained
using
the
tt
dim
tt
function

alternatively

Introduction
South
Carolina
is
not
a
stranger
to
using
technology
or
experimenting
with
laptops
in
the
classroom
In
1997
South
Carolina
provided
300
middle
school
students
in
Beauford
County
with
laptop
computers
for
use
in
the
classroom
The
equipment
and
software
was
provided
by
Microsoft
and
Toshiba
In
January
1998
an
article
about
their
experience
was
published
in
Learning
and
Leading
with
Technology
Although
the
article
does
not
report
specific
statistical
results
it
appears
as
though
the
laptops
were
received
very
enthusiastically
by
teachers
and
students
The
focus
on
their
usage
appears
to
have
been
in
expediting
the
writing
process
from
the
brainstorming
stages
to
the
final
product
It
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
role
of
the
teacher
seemed
to
change
in
the
classrooms
participating
in
the
program
The
author
reports
Teachers
roles
in
technology
rich
classrooms
can
be
flexible
and
interactive
and
change
constantly
Teachers
may
start
out
acting
solely
as
instructors
giving
students
the
required
information
for
their
assignments
But
then
they
most
quickly
switch
to
other
roles
such
as
facilitators
passive
managers
and
active
managers

Summary
What
is
Politics
Politics
is
the
process
by
which
groups
of
people
make
decisions
The
term
is
generally
applied
to
behaviour
within
w
civil
governments
civil
governments
but
politics
has
been
observed
in
all
human
group
interactions
including
corporate
academic
and
religious
institutions
It
consists
of
social
relations
involving
authority
or
power
the
regulation
of
political
units
and
the
methods
and
tactics
used
to
formulate
and
apply
social
policy

Barack
Obama
President
of
the
United
States
derives
his
authority
from
a
rational
legal
system
of
laws
outlined
in
a
formal
document
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
of
America
Power
Political
power
is
a
type
of
power
held
by
a
group
in
a
society
which
allows
that
group
to
administrate
the
distribution
of
public
resources
including
labour
and
wealth
Political
powers
are
not
limited
to
heads
of
states
however
the
extent
to
which
a
person
or
group
such
as
an
insurgency
terrorist
group
or
multinational
corporation
possesses
such
power
relates
to
the
amount
of
societal
influence
they
can
wield
formally
or
informally
Power
then
is
often
defined
as
the
ability
to
influence
the
behavior
of
others
with
or
without
resistance

Authority
In
government
authority
is
often
used
interchangeably
with
the
term
power
However
their
meanings
differ
Authority
refers
to
a
claim
of
legitimacy
the
justification
and
right
to
exercise
power
For
example
while
a
mob
has
the
power
to
punish
a
criminal
for
example
by
lynching
people
who
believe
in
the
rule
of
law
consider
that
only
a
court
of
law
has
the
authority
to
order
capital
punishment

Joseph
Smith
Jr
founder
of
Mormonism
derived
his
authority
from
his
charisma
Max
Weber
identified
and
distinguished
three
types
of
legitimate
authority
The
first
type
discussed
by
Weber
is
Rational
legal
authority
It
is
that
form
of
authority
which
depends
for
its
legitimacy
on
formal
rules
and
established
laws
of
the
state
which
are
usually
written
down
and
are
often
very
complex
The
power
of
the
rational
legal
authority
is
mentioned
in
a
document
like
a
constitution
or
articles
of
incorporation
Modern
societies
depend
on
legal
rational
authority
Government
officials
like
the
w
President
of
the
United
States
President
of
the
United
States
are
good
examples
of
this
form
of
authority
The
second
type
of
authority
is
Traditional
authority
which
derives
from
long
established
customs
habits
and
social
structures
When
power
passes
from
one
generation
to
another
then
it
is
known
as
traditional
authority
The
right
of
hereditary
w
monarchy
monarchs
to
rule
like
the
w
King
of
Saudi
Arabia
King
of
Saudi
Arabia
is
an
example
The
third
form
of
authority
is
Charismatic
authority
Here
the
w
charisma
charisma
of
the
individual
or
the
leader
plays
an
important
role
Charismatic
authority
is
that
authority
which
is
derived
from
a
gift
of
grace
the
power
of
one
s
personality
or
when
the
leader
claims
that
his
authority
is
derived
from
a
higher
power
e
g
God
that
is
superior
to
both
the
validity
of
traditional
and
rational
legal
authority
Followers
accept
this
and
are
willing
to
follow
this
higher
or
inspired
authority
in
the
place
of
the
authority
that
they
have
hitherto
been
following
Clear
examples
of
charismatic
leaders
are
often
seen
in
the
founders
of
religious
groups
w
Joseph
Smith
Jr

The
Church
of

Christ
of

Saints
LDS
or

considered
charismatic

who
used
his

to
gather
followers
ultimately
for

nefarious
purposes
was
w

Violence
In
most
modern
nation
states
the
government
has
authority
which
gives
it
power
Intriguingly
the
fact
that
the
government
has
authority
gives
it
the
right
to
use
power
to
force
citizens
to
do
what
the
government
deems
appropriate
In
other
words
the
government
has
the
right
based
on
its
authority
to
force
people
to
behave
in
certain
ways
Refusal
to
follow
the
dictates
of
the
government
can
result
in
the
government
using
violence
to
coerce
individuals
into
compliance
At
the
same
time
the
fact
that
the
government
of
a
country
has
the
right
to
use
violence
theoretically
a
near
exclusive
right
others
can
use
violence
only
when
officially
sanctioned
such
as
when
one
purchases
a
hunting
license
or
if
one
belongs
to
a
government
sanctioned
fighting
league
like
the
w
Ultimate
Fighting
Championship
UFC
reinforces
the
government
s
claim
to
authority
Thus
you
have
something
of
a
paradox
Do
governments
have
authority
if
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
use
violence
And
do
governments
derive
their
authority
from
their
right
to
use
violence
Another
way
to
think
about
this
quirk
of
politics
is
to
ask
yourself
Would
you
follow
the
law
if
there
were
no
repercussions
to
your
behavior
While
you
may
for
other
reasons
e
g
a
Hobbesian
w
Social
contract
social
contract
ultimately
it
is
the
threat
of
the
legitimate
use
of
violence
that
makes
government
authority
compelling
Types
of

In
addition
to
there
existing

legitimate
means
of

However
if
any
democracy
is
not
carefully
legislated
to
avoid
an
uneven
distribution
of
political
power
with
balances
such
as
the
separation
of
powers
then
a
branch
of
the
system
of
rule
could
accumulate
power
and
become
harmful
to
the
democracy
itself
The
majority
rule
is
often
described
as
a
characteristic
feature
of
democracy
but
without
responsible
government
it
is
possible
for
the
rights
of
a
minority
to
be
abused
by
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
An
essential
process
in
representative
democracies
are
competitive
elections
that
are
fair
both
substantively
and
procedurally
Furthermore
freedom
of
political
expression
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press
are
essential
so
that
citizens
are
informed
and
able
to
vote
in
their
personal
interests
Totalitarianism
Totalitarianism
or
totalitarian
rule
is
a
political
system
that
strives
to

every
aspect

Totalitarian
regimes
or
movements
maintain
themselves
in
political
power
by
means
of
an
official
all
embracing

and

Communist

may

but
the
Communist
party
is
usually
granted
a
special
or
dominant
role
in
government
often
by
statute
or
under
the
constitution
Consequently
the
institutions
of

of

of

A

party
is
a
political
organization
that
seeks
to
attain
and
maintain
political
power
within
government
usually
by
participating
in
electoral

Parties
often
espouse

bolstered
by
a
written
platform
with
specific
goals
forming
a
coalition
among
disparate
interests
USA
The
United
States
Constitution
is
silent
on
the
subject
of
political
organizations
mainly
because
most
of
the
founding
fathers
disliked
them
Yet
major
and
minor
political
parties
and
groups
soon
arose
primarily
through
the
efforts
of
these
same
founding
fathers
In
partisan
elections
candidates
are
nominated
by
a
political
party
or
seek
public
office
as
an
independent
Each
state
has
significant
discretion
in
deciding
how
candidates
are
nominated
and
thus

Typically
major
party
candidates
are
formally
chosen
in
a

or
convention
whereas
minor

representatives
and

are
required
to

American
political
parties
are
more
loosely
organized
than
those
in
other
countries
The
two
major
parties
in
particular
have
no
formal
organization
at
the
national
level
that
controls
membership
activities
or
policy
positions
though
some
state
affiliates
do
Thus
for
an
American
to
say
that
he
or
she
is
a
member
of
the
Democratic
or
Republican
party
is
quite
different
from
a
Briton
s
stating
that
he
or
she
is
a
member
of
the

Labour
party
Labour

In
the
United
States
one
can
often
become
a
member
of
a
party
merely
by
stating
that
fact
In
some
U
S
states
a
voter
can
register
as
a
member
of
one
or
another
party
and
or
vote
in
the
primary
election
for
one
or
another
party
but
such
participation
does
not
restrict
one
s
choices
in
any
way
nor
does
it
give
a
person
any
particular
rights
or
obligations
with
respect
to
the
party
other
than
possibly
allowing
that
person
to
vote
in
that
party
s
primary
elections
elections
that
determine
who
the
candidate
of
the
party
will
be
A
person
may
choose
to
attend
meetings
of
one
local
party
committee
one
day
and
another
party
committee
the
next
day
The
sole
factor
that
brings
one
closer
to
the
action
is
the
quantity
and
quality
of
participation
in
party
activities
or
financial
donations
to
the
party
and
the
ability
to
persuade
others
in
attendance
to
give
one
responsibility
Party
identification
becomes
somewhat
formalized
when
a
person
runs
for
partisan
office
In
most
states
this
means
declaring
oneself
a
candidate
for
the
nomination
of
a
particular
party
and
intent
to
enter
that
party
s
primary
election
for
an
office
A
party
committee
may
choose
to
endorse
one
or
another
of
those
who
is
seeking
the
nomination
but
in
the
end
the
choice
is
up
to
those
who
choose
to
vote
in
the
primary
and
it
is
often
difficult
to
tell
who
is
going
to
do
the
voting
The
result
is
that
American
political
parties
have
weak
central
organizations
and
little
central
ideology
except
by
consensus
A
party
really
cannot
prevent
a
person
who
disagrees
with
the
majority
of
positions
of
the
party
or
actively
works
against
the
party
s
aims
from
claiming
party
membership
so
long
as
the
voters
who
choose
to
vote
in
the
primary
elections
elect
that
person
Once
in
office
an
elected
official
may
change
parties
simply
by
declaring
such
intent
At
the
federal
level
each
of
the
two
major
parties
has
a
national
committee
See
w
Democratic
National

Republican
National
Committee
that
acts
as
the
hub
for
much
of
the
fund
raising
and
campaign
activities
particularly
in
presidential
campaigns
The
exact
composition
of
these
committees
is
different
for
each
party
but
they
are
made
up
primarily
of
representatives
from
state
parties

organizations
and
other
individuals
important
to

multi

system
with
numerous
parties
in
which
no
one
party
often
has
a
chance
of
gaining
power
alone
and
parties
must
work
with
each
other
to
form
coalition
governments
A
multi
party
system
is
a
system
in
which
three
or
more
political
parties
have
the
capacity
to
gain
control
of
government
separately
or
in
coalition
Unlike
a
single
party
system
or
a
non
partisan
democracy
it
encourages
the
general
constituency
to
form
multiple
distinct
officially
recognized
groups
generally
called
political
parties
Each
party
competes
for
votes
from
the
enfranchised
constituents
those
allowed
to
vote
A
multi
party
system
is
essential
for
representative
democracies
because
it
prevents
the
leadership
of
a
single
party
from
setting
policy
without
challenge
If
the
government
includes
an
elected
Congress
or
Parliament
the
parties
may
share
power
according
to
Proportional
Representation
or
the
First
past
the
post
system
In
Proportional
Representation
each
party
wins
a
number
of
seats
proportional
to
the
number
of
votes
it
receives
In
first
past
the
post
the
electorate
is
divided
into
a
number
of
districts
each
of
which
selects
one
person
to
fill
one
seat
by
a
plurality
of
the
vote
First
past
the
post
is
not
conducive
to
a
proliferation
of
parties
and
naturally
gravitates
toward
a
two
party
system
in
which
only
two
parties
have
a
real
chance
of
electing
their
candidates
to
office

as

This
difference
is
not
without
implications
A
two
party
system
requires
voters
to
align
themselves
in
large
blocs
sometimes
so
large
that
they
cannot
agree
on
any
overarching
principles
Along
this
line
of
thought
some
theories
argue
that
this
allows
centrists
to
gain
control
On
the
other
hand
if
there
are
multiple
major
parties
each
with
less
than
a
majority
of
the
vote
the
parties
are
forced
to
work
together
to
form
working
governments
This
also
promotes
a
form
of
centrism
The
United
States
is
an
example
of
where
there
may
be
a
multi
party
system
but
that
only
two
parties
have
ever
formed
government
Germany
India
France
and
Israel
are
examples
of
nations
that
have
used
a
multi
party
system
effectively
in
their
democracies
though
in
each
case
there
are
two
parties
larger
than
all
others
even
though
most
of
the
time
no
party
has
a
parliamentary
majority
by
itself
In
these
nations
multiple
political
parties
have
often
formed
coalitions
for
the
purpose
of
developing
power
blocs
for
governing
The
multi
party
system
of
proportional
representation
has
allowed
a
small
third
party
w
Pirate
Party
The
Pirate
Party
to
come
to
prominence
in
Sweden
something
that
would
be
very
unlikely
in
the
United
States
The
Pirate
Party
strives
to
reform
laws
regarding
copyright
and
patents
The
agenda
also
includes
support
for
a
strengthening
of
the
right
to
privacy
both
on
the
Internet
and
in
everyday
life
and
the
transparency
of
state
administration
The
Party
has
intentionally
chosen
to
be
block
independent
on
the
traditional
left
right
scale
to
pursue
their
political
agenda
with
all
mainstream
parties
The
Pirate
Party
is
the
third
largest
party
in
Sweden
in
terms
of
membership
Its
sudden
popularity
has
given
rise
to
parties

Politics
and
Race
Generally
racial
and
ethnic
minorities
are
less
likely
to
vote
in
elections
and
are
also
underrepresented
in
political
positions
but
these
numbers
are
often
influenced
by
ongoing
attempts
throughout
American
history
to
make
voting
harder
and
at
times
impossible
for
racial
minorities
The
graph
below
illustrates
the
disparate
voting
rates
between
racial

groups

Racial

are

In

this

are
more

Racial

If

Politics

that
political

is

Politics
and
Ideology
Recent

in

There

gap
between
individuals
who
espouse

Conservatism

in
3
easy
steps
locate
your
personal

add
the
script
to
it
and
bypass
your

Each
step
is
detailed
below
Log
in
and
locate
your
personal

page
First
make
sure
you
are
logged
in
Only
logged
in
users
can
install
scripts
by
modifying
a
personal
userscripts
page
This
page
can
be
located
as
follows
If
you
use
default
Monobook
skin
this
special
link
Special
Mypage
monobook
js
your
monobook
js
points
to
this
page
If
you
set
some
other
skin
in
your
Special
Preferences
Preferences
see
Wikipedia
Skin
for
corresponding
subpage
name
Note
that
many
scripts
are
designed
with
Monobook
skin
in
mind
Such
scripts
should
also
work
in
Chick
Simple
and
Myskin
and
are
less
likely
to
work
in
Classic
Nostalgia
and
Cologne
Blue
If
you
use
Modern
skin
try
enabling
a
special
compatibility
gadget
in
your
preferences
Add
the
script
to
your
personal
userscripts
page
One
way
to
install
a
script
is
to
simply
copy
the
whole
script
code
into
your
monobook
js
You
will
thereafter
have
your
own
copy
of
the
script
which
will
not
be
updated
automatically
you
must
do
it
yourself
Importing
is
a
preferred
and
most
popular
way
to
install
a
userscript
It
makes
your
monobook
js
more
readable
and
automatically
keeps
you
up
to
date
with
script
updates
and
fixes
This
is
done

Hello
I
just
popped
up
here
after
seeing
who
edited
my
half
done
book
on
chess
strategy
and
just
thought
I
might
like
to
tell
you
that
I
ll
be
around
every
once
in
a
while
to
work
on
Wikibooks
Chess
the
project
re
Hello
hi
ChessCreator
Thanks
for
your
welcome
Actually
I
ve
been
involved
with
this
book
since
2005
but
repeatedly
gave
up
out
of
frustration
at
apparently
being
the
only
one
here
so
I
m
extremely
glad
to
see
some
new
names
on
board
As
you
ll
see
from
the
main
discussion
page
it
was
me
that
turned
Opening
Theory
in
Chess
into
a
stand
alone
book
My
contributions
so
far
have
been
mostly
in
the
Ruy
also
the
first
few
moves
of
the
Frankenstein
Dracula
and
the
intro
page
My
plan
now
is
to
bring
the
Sveshnikov
up
to
scratch
Maybe
I
ll
also
make
a
general
survey
of
the
book
that
tells
us
which
main
lines
are
here
already
and
which
urgently
need
adding

Re

I
can
t

i

the

like
an

that

On

this

its
not
a

This
should
really
be
either
an

one
of
the

or
moved
to
Subject
Chess
and
cleaned
up
to
list
only
the

and
perhaps
link
to
the

for

book
for
a
complete

of

for

Subject
pages
sort
of
function
as
lists
for
a

and
should
in
my
opinion
also
function
as
the
Wikipedia
equivalents
of
disambigious
pages
for

rather
than

as

Re

Help
I
m
not
able
to
use
my
bot
right
now
but
I
should
be
able
to
make
all
those
changes
by
monday
night
Also
my

is
not
currently
able
to
move
pages
although
that
is
functionality
that
I
ve
been
meaning
to
implement
for
a
long
while
now
Maybe
next
week
I
can
start
writing
up
a
mass
move
bot
to
help
with
this
kind
of
task
Keeping
the
Chess
and
Opening
theory
in
chess
book
separate
is
probably
a
good
thing
Imagine
trying
to
merge
together
the
ECO
and
Nimzowitsch
s
My
System
One
discusses
openings
the
other
discusses
gameplay
We
don
t
need
to
force
mergers
about
books
that
are
about
a
single
subject
but
which
are
distinct
Of
course
if
you
believe
that
they
are
better
merged
together
that
s
fine
too
I
ll
set
up
and
run
my
bot
on
monday
evening
possibly
tuesday
morning
I
ll
also
see
what
I
can
come
up
with
for
page
moves
in
case
you
still
want
to
go
through
with
that
change

License

a
kind
of
copyleft
which
means

license
designed

We
have
designed
this
License
in
order
to
use
it
for

for
free

because
free
software
needs
free

a

should
come
with

providing
the

that

does

this

is
not

it
can
be
used
for

work
regardless
of

This
work
certainly
qualifies
for
a
speedy
I
tagged
it
with
a
nowiki
query
nowiki
which
was
deleted
Then
I
tagged
it
with
nowiki
Impending
Doom
nowiki
Also
deleted
Someone
else
tagged
it
with
a
suggestion
that
it
be
moved
Also
deleted
Since
this
guy
wasn
t
willing
to
listen
I
deleted
the
page
That
got
his
attention
though
not
in
a
good
way
as
one
might
imagine
Even
though
the
author
then
began
levelling
threats
and
has
since
been
blocked
by
another
admin
I
thought
it
would
be
decent
to
undelete
to
allow
him
a
second
chance
to
move
the
data
elsewhere
I
am
willing
to
let
that
stand
for
a
day
or
two
but
not
much
longer
Unless
the
consensus
here
is
different

I
imagine
that
if
it
was
transwikied
the
author
might
still
be
offended
and
want
to
continue
to
work
on
it
at

I
agree
that
it

The
work
doesn
t
belong
here
because
it
appears
to
be
unestablished
conlang
with
no
defined
grammar
and
vocabulary
that
can
be
verified
That
along
with
Eeke
is
a
group
of
constructed
languages
created
by
me
is
what
makes
it
appear
to
be
original
research
If
that
is
not
the
case
then
some
references
to
some
reliable
sources
would
help
Also
this
work
could
be
interpreted
as
self
promotion
if
the
conlang
s
does
actually
exist
but
is
not
well
known
yet

This

I
would

is

Given
there
was
no
more
activity
from
the
author
it
s
safe
to
delete
Since
it
appears
he
managed
to
write
a

its
translation
it

unlikely
that
he

This
simple
function
converts
a
long
int
to
an
eight
byte
representation
of
it
This
is
good
for
networking
systems
etc
so
instead
of
sending
640000000000
it
would
send
just
eight
bytes
There
are
other
uses
for
banks
their
uses
are
seemingly
endless

If
your
grill
or
smoker
has
retreated
from
your
use
this
is
the
guide
to
get
you
started
again
Meats
and
Cuts
If
you
re
either
cooking
low
and
slow
or
hot
and
fast
you
ll
want
to
pick
a
cut
that
s
got
a
good
amount
of
marbling
Good
chicken
cuts
include
Whole
leg
quarters
thighs
drumsticks
wings
and
whole
butterflied
chickens
Breasts
can
be
dry
and
flavorless
Nice
beef
cuts
Tender
steaks
flank
inside
skirt
and
briskets
Pork
isn
t
that
lucky
though
See
before
the
fitness
craze
came
pigs
were
fat
In
fact
the
average
pig
had
more
fat
than
50
chicken
leg
quarters
I
actually
got
to
taste
that
meat
before
it
was
gone
But
people
crazy
about
fitness
turned
from
pigs
to
poultry
Undaunted
pig
breeders
made
the
once
juicy
hog
dry
Anyways
cuts
that
have
the
right
stuff
include
Boston
butts
ribs
and
chops
Cooking
The
type
of
barbecue
cooking
that
you
choose
for
a
cut
matters
almost
as
much
as
the
cut
you
pick
Cuts
that
like
a
long
cook
time
in
the
smoker
are
Boston
butts
ribs
beef
brisket
chicken
thighs
and
legs
wings
and
whole
chickens
Try
to
do
a
long
smoke
time
with
things
like
filet
mignons
and
you
ll
get
something
extremely
mushy
like
cat
food
Cuts
that
like
it
hot
and
fast
are
Pork
chops
chicken
breasts
steaks
like
ribeyes
and
strips
ahi
tuna
fish
and
shrimp

Woods
Think
all
smoking
woods
are
the
same
Wrong
Each
wood
has
its
own
flavor
and
character
However
if
you
use
softwoods
like
cedar
pine
and
spruce
you
ll
get
toxic
tars
resins
and
creosote
which
can
kill
That
s
why
you
ll
want
to
use
hardwoods
I
have
a
chart
concerning
flavor
of
smoke
Alder
Classic
European
smoking
wood
doesn
t
overtake
complements
meats
with
mild
flavor
and
seafood
such
as
trout
Applewood
Adds
a
cider
like
flavor
to
meats
and
fish
Nicely
complements
items
with
honey
or
meats
such
as
chicken
pork
and
lamb
Cherry
Fruity
tad
bitter
smoke
that
complements
pork
Hickory
Classic
American
wood
Adds
a
sharp
woodsy
flavor
Complements
pork
chicken
seafood
and
shrimp
Maple
Sweet
maple
syrup
flavor
Complements
almost
everything
Mesquite
Gives
a
spicy
Southwestern
flair
to
beef
However
mesquite
can
overtake
mild
flavored
meats
like
pork
and
chicken
Peachwood
Sweet
fruity
flavor
Complements
pork
chicken
salmon
trout
and
shrimp
I
hope
we
ve
inspired
you
to
take
your
grill
or
smoker
out
of
the
shadows
and
fire
it
up
Notes
Like
the
way
that
last
line
was
written
I
borrowed
that
from
Good
Eats
recipe
A
spice
rub
is
a
mixture
of
salt
herbs
and
spices
A
spice
rub
can
be
as
simple
as
a
large
amount
of
pepper
like
in
Steak
au
Poirve
or
as
complex
as
100
spices
and
yes
that
many
spices
do
exist
My
formula
for
a
good
spice
rub
is
a
base
such
as
paprika
and
then
add
on
from
there
However
beware
commercial
spice
mixtures
Many
of
them
are
salt
based
because
1
Salt
fills
volume
2
Salt
is
cheap
3
Salt
fills
in
for
spices
they
can
t
get
In
order
to
make
a
successful
rub
you
need
to
balance
flavors
I
like
to
build
my
rubs
in
bulk
because
spices
last
close
to
forever
and
also
I
won
t
have
to
make
another
batch
every
2
days
because
trust
me
when
you
find
a
good
rub
you
will
use
it
often
Also
if
you
re
making
a
rub
for
one
certain
item
you
ll
want
to
pick
flavors
that
work
well
with
what
you
re
making
it
for
Pork
likes
brown
sugar
rosemary
and
chipotles
Chicken
pretty
much
likes
the
same
things
as
pork
and
things
like
lemon
lime
orange
cayenne
pepper
and
dry
mustard
powder
Beef
likes
all
of
these
Also
paprika
seems
to
work
with
just
about
everything
Here
is
a
recipe
for
an
all
purpose
rub
Ingredients
1
cup

1
4

Procedure

all
ingredients
in

Hi
I
m
usually
on
the
cookbook
adding
stuff
but
I
can
also
be
found
at
Wikipedia
as
Altonbrownisawesome
As
you
can
see
I
m
an
avid
Alton
Brown
fan
For
those
of
you
that
believe
all
those
guys
that
say
acids
in
marinades
supposedly
tenderize
meats
that

Tenderizers
use

I
made
this
book
because
I
felt
that
a
lot
of
people
don
t
know
basic
food
safety
and
there
are
a
large
amount
of
illnesses
caused
by
contaminated
food
registered
by
the
CDC
in
America
In
Chapter
One
I
wrote
about
how
to
be
careful
not
to
cross
contaminate
by
poor
storage
and
unwashed
tools
In
Chapter
Two
I
wrote
about
cooking
meats
to
an
appropriate
temperature
before
consumption
In
Chapter
Three
I
wrote
about
how
to
properly
store
items
meant
for
consumption
In
Chapter
Four
I
wrote
about
common
food
safety
myths
I
hope
you
learn
a
lot
from
this
book

This
is

book
for
people

I
m
nominating
this
for
deletion
because
it
s
now
been
merged
into
Introduction
to
Psychology
where
appropriate
Chapter
1
and
Chapter
3
have
been
merged
while
Chapter
2
and
4
remain
However
2
and
4
are
only
a
collection
of
links
to
Wikipedia
articles
and
do
not
contain
actual
content
On
a
more
subjective
note
the
book
was
apparently
named
after
its
creator
which
is
pretty
anathema
to
the
concept
of
an
open
wiki

FYI
Chapter
1
was
simply
moved
into
the
Introduction
to
Psychology
as
a
subpage
but
Chapter
3
does
need
a
history
merge
I
did
that
one
manually

The
Problem
Most
software
programs
are
made
because
there
is
a
problem
that
needs
to
be
addressed
or
solved
Before
a
problem
can
be
addressed
you
need
to
clearly
identify
the
problem
or
problems
that
need
to
be
addressed
In
this
section
you
will
learn
basic
skills
to
identifying
problems
Problem
Statement
A
problem
statement
is
a
description
of
the
issues
that
need
to
be
addressed
A
good
problem
statement
answers
What
is
the
problem
This
should
help
explain
why
a
program
is
needed
Who
has
the
problem
This
should
help
identify
who
is
likely
to
use
the
program
If
the
answers
are
too
general
thinking
and
creativity
may
be
required

I
m
sorry
but
I
don
t
believe
this
book
is
within
the
scope
of
Wikibooks
It
s
not
a
textbook
intended
to
teach
a

Additionally
I
feel
it
puts
us
at
risk
for
copyright
violation
for
the
lyrics
you
ve
posted
for
songs
that
are
not

And
if
the

were

they
d
be
a
better
fit
at

instead

This
book
was
apparently
created
for
a
class
project
Human
Resources
Management
is
what
I
assume
the
HRM
stands
for
If
you
look
at
Category
Hot
Topics
in
HRM
2007
you
might
see
a
great
number
of
pages
However
look
at
any
of
those
pages
and
they
have
at
most
a
link
to
rate
the
page
Given
the
2007
in
the
title
and
the
main
contributor
s
last
efforts
made
in
December
2006
it
would
appear
the
book
is
no
longer
relevant
to
any
class
and
stands
little
hope
of
going
anywhere
or
serving
any
purpose

defines
several
functional
data
structures
for
Common
Lisp
Functional
data
structures
also
sometimes
known
as
persistent
data
structures
are
data
structures
that
are
immutable
or
do
not
modify
their
contents
Instead
of
modifying
they
creates
a
new
object
which
has
some
changes
in
it
but
is
otherwise
the
same
as
the
old
This
may
seem
inefficient
but
the
new
object
is
created
in
such
a
way
that
it
shares
much
of
its
contents
with
the
old
object
making
this
a
cheap
operation
By
using
these
techniques
functional
data
structures
can
come
close
to
providing
the
same
performance
as
mutable
data
structures
but
without
the
added
complexity
of
mutable
state
One
functional
data
structure
that
every
Lisp
programmer
is
familiar
with
is
the
list
While
a
list
can
be
destructively
modified
it
isn
t
in
standard
usage
and
operations
on
lists
produce
new
lists
that
share
structure
with
the
original
list
For
instance
you
can
CONS
an
element
onto
the
head
of
a
list
and
the
list
returned
shares
the
entire
old
list
but
with
a
new
head
tacked
in
front
of
the
old
one
Functional
data
structures
are
particularly
useful
for
multiprocessing
applications
as
they
can
remove
the
danger
of
one
process
changing
a
shared
data
structure
in
a
way
that
invalidates
that
structure
for
another
processes

Software
testing
Software
testing
is
used
to
gain
valuable
information
about
a
program
s
quality
and
can
be
used
to
uncover
problems
Software
testing
is
only
as
good
at
the
conditions
tested
for
Untested
conditions
can
still
cause
a
program
to
function
in
unexpected
ways
Knowing
what
requirements
and
priorities
the
program
has
is
a
major
step
in
preparation
for
software
testing
Software
testing
can
help
you
find
answers
to
Are
the
requirements
for
the
program
satisfied
Are
there
any
gaps
in
the
program
s
requirements
Are
there
defects
or
failures
in
the
program
s
designed
Are
there
any
unexpected
errors

one
button
testing
That
makes
it
much
more
convenient
to
type
a
little
then
hit
that
button
which
saves
the
file
you
just
edited
compiles
the
application
with
all
the
appropriate
options
such
as
fno
emit
frame
if
necessary
and
runs
a
few
quick
tests
to
make
sure
your
improvements
don
t
accidentally
break
something
else
Spending
an
hour
to
code
up
a
few
tests
and
set
up
one
button
testing
may
seem
like
it
is
more
hassle
than
it
is
worth
Manually
compiling
the
file
and
manually
run
through
the
various
parts
of
the
application
to
make
sure
they
work
may
take
far
less
than
an
hour
But
trust
me
most
programs
you
are
going
to
edit
compile
test
many
many
times
And
a
year
from
now
when
you
make
just
one
tiny
little
change
wouldn
t
you
much
rather
push
the
button
and
be
done
with
it
rather
than
manually
compile
the
file
manually
run
through
the
application
and
see
that
it
suddenly
it
doesn
t
work
any
more
pull
out
your
hair
until
hours
later
you
remember
you
needed
to
include
fno
emit
frame
manually
re
compile
the
file
this
time
with
fno
emit
frame
start
testing
all
over
from
the
beginning

I
believe
a
hierarchical
structure
is
necessary
with
the
current
page
naming
You
ll
notice
that
the
sections
under
The
Problem
Solutions
Identifying
The
Approach
and
Quality
Requirements
have
identical
pages
The
flat
structure
will
result
in
name
conflicts
while
a
structure
using
chapters
will
allow
pages
of
the
same
names
that
are
associated
with
each
chapter

The

structure
also
allows
pages
of
the

name
to
be
associated
with
more
than
one
chapter
The

allows

I
m
very
disappointed
that
you
didn
t
wait
for
the
original
author
of
the
book
to
comment
before
completely
changing
the
structure
of
the
book
again
Did
Darklama
want
Trial
and
Error
to
be
in
more
than
one
chapter
From
the
original
structure
it
would
appear
to
be
no
but
that
is
why
I
began
a
discussion
on
this
to

The
flat
approach
only
makes
since
if
the
intent
was
to
identify
problems
solutions
and
approaches
in
one
go
which
is
not
the
intent
While
a
problem
solving
approach
is
intended
to
be
used
in
the
first
three
units
sections
breaking
it
down
is
intended
to
make
the
process
easier
for
people
new
to
the
process
keep
people
focused
on
doing
one
step
at
a
time
and
also
help
people
to
see
what
the
similarities
and
the
differences
are
in
each
step
on
their
own
without
forcing
too
much
information
on
them
at
once
This
has
nothing
to
do
with
hierarchy
but
rather
separating
concepts
Too
little
separation
can
also
be
considered
harmful
and
can
lead
to
its
own
problems

Well

me

div
is
a

statement
but
you
still
have
to
put
it
into
a

typing
from

if

So
you
still
have

backwards
Oh
and
does

understand

Can
t
silence
nowiki
ref
nowiki
tag
error
message
with
display
none
style
I
am
running
into
a
problem
with
the
cite
extension
The
nowiki
ref
nowiki
tag
will
tell
you
if
you
fail
to
put
a
nowiki
references
nowiki
tag
at
the
end
of
a
page
This
is
very
unhelpful
if
you
want
to
use
nowiki
ref
nowiki
tags
in
templates
One
way
around
this
is
to
embed
the
nowiki
ref
nowiki
tags
in
nowiki
div
style
display
none
div
nowiki
sections
This
seems
to
work
if
the
group
parameter
is
null
But
if
it
isn
t
the
error
magically
bleeds
out
of
the
display
none
section
For
example
the
following
does
not
generate
a
visible
error
nowiki
div
style
display
none
nowiki
br
nowiki
ref
name

group
cite
class
book
style
font
style
normal
Blah
blah

cite
ref
br
nowiki
br
nowiki
div
nowiki
br
However
the
following
markup
results
in
a
visible
error
nowiki
div
style
display
none
nowiki
br
nowiki
ref
name
first
group

Since
the
second

i
e
the

does

there
appears
to
be

Well
if
your
looking
for
a
solution
that
will
work
on
all
projects
don
t
use
display
none
The
simplest
solution
is
to
include
nowiki
noinclude

noinclude

Unfortunately

The

ref
nowiki

the

Citation
lists

transcluded
silently

Silence
is
imposed
by
the

Using
nowiki
noinclude

noinclude

would
eliminate
the

on

not

Generating

Hi

wondering
if

Using

Yes
there
is
but
it
s
a
little
bit
of
a
manual
process
though
not
that
bad
and
the
output
is
really
pretty
good
If
you
look
in
the
side

on

you
should
see
a
section
called
Create
a
book
with
two
links
in
it
Navigate
to
the
first
chapter
of
the
book
you
want
a

of
and
then
click
the
link
that
says
Add

page
Then
go
to
the
next
chapter
and
click
it
again
Repeat
until
you
have
added
every
module
in
the
book
you
want
Finally
click
on
Show
collection
page
From
there
you
can
rearrange
delete
etc
When
you
re

with
your

save
it
and
then

from
that

Hi
all
For

Wings

User
Manual
I
would
want
to
add
some
swf
files
with
instructions
that
are
easy
to
follow
even
by
newbies
These
flash
files
are
created
with
http

wink
Wink
look
a
little
bit
like
a
video
but
in
essence
are
some
carefully
choosen
screenshots
with
the
added
value
of
text
explanations
bubbles
navigation
buttons
and
the
video
impression
achived
by
animating
the
cursor
movement
Here
a
selfmade

htm
sample
of
what
I
plan
to
do
be
sure
to
have
read
the
following
before
you
click
you
have
to
trust
me
and
the
Wink
author
and
the
vendor
of
the
Flash
player
One
problem
with
swf
is
that
it
may
contain
ActionScript
a
derivative
of
ECMA
aka
JavaScript
and
thus
may
be
a
security
risk
principally
On
the
other
hand
the
needed
player
runs
in
sort
of
a
sandbox
and
can
by
default
only
write
to
a
very
limited
area
on
the
users
file
system
it
s
cookies
somewhere
But
then
again
even
that
limited
feature
is
known
to
be
exploited
e
g
by
YouTube
to
keep
record
of
the
users
sound
volume
settings
regardless
of
the
domain
where
the
video
is
played
and
who
knows
what
else
is
possible
with
just
that
limited
access
Other
problems
swf
is
NOT
accepted
by
Commons
because
it
is
a
proprietary
format
though
widespread
Wink
is
free
but
is
not
Open
Source
Nevertheless
I
think
such
tutorial
sequences
would
help
the
Wings3D
book
a
lot
Wings3D
itself
IS
Open
Source
and
my
tut
s
will
be
licensed
under
the
GFDL
the
above
one
link
IS
GFDL
though
not
noted

itself

I
spent
several

output
without
success
so
far
search
phrase
convert
swf
to

from
the

then
the
one

service
isn
t
alive
any
more
and

Exploit
seems
to
be
unable
to
do
that
Illustrator
might
be
able
to
do
it
but
is
ruled
out
because
it
s
not
free
at
all
and
I
don
t
have
it
If
onyone
has
another
hint
for
a
converter
or
some
other
way
including
some
scripting
solution
to
produce
svg

would

With
bookshelves
each
bookshelf
must
be
edited
With
subject
pages
editing
the
book
is
all
that
is
required
in
most
cases
Some
bookshelves
have
already
been
turned
into
redirects
to
subject
pages
More
are
likely
to
follow
as
more
books
currently
listed
on
bookshelves
are
listed
on
subject
pages
By
following
the
new
system
and
not
editing
bookshelves
bookshelves
can
be
more
quickly
phased
out
or
replaced
The
links
on
the
main
page
will
likely
be
updated
once
people
can
use
subjects
to
find
all
the
books
they
use
to
be
able
to
find
on
bookshelves
The
less
people
use
the
bookshelves
to
list
new
books
the
sooner
they
can
be
phased
out
or
replaced

The
friendly
answer
is
some
bookshelves
are
protected
thus
you
must
log
in
to

them
I

not

you
might

I

In

there
has
been
discussion
on
whether
or
not
the
development
stages
even
make
sense
because
books
can
continue
to

aren

When
I
think
of

I
think
of

cycle
which
goes
something
like
drafting
outlining
expanding
refining
correcting

Is
the
plan
to
also
deprecate
putting
the
development
stage
next
to
the
books
title
on
what
ever
page
we
list
books
on
All
your
comments
about
what
a
development
stage
are
are
interesting
I
just
find
it
handy
to
know
how
complete
the
authors
feel
the
book
is
when
I
am
opening
it
up
Somehow
I
always
felt
that
was
one
of
the
strengths
of
the
project
Maybe
nothing
was
perfect
but
the
books
themselves
often
let
you
know
how
imperfect

I
think
that
would
be
the
result
yes
What
about
featured
books
Isn
t
that
useful
for
knowing
what
the

Featured
books
are
wonderful
But
almost
all
of
the
books
I
have
read
here
have
not
been
featured
books
For
me
the
development
stages
doesn
t
tell
me
about
how
great
a
book
is
it
tells
me
about
where
the
book
is
good
or
bad
Featured
books
being
a
substitute
for
development
stages
would
be
rather
like
asking
students
to
submit
lists
of
classes
where
they
received
A
s
instead
of
submitting
their
transcript
It
is
nice
information
but
not
a
substitute
I
suppose
as
a
follow
question
is
it
also
necessary
to
only
use
automatically
generated
lists
on
the
subject
pages
as
well

No
its
not
considered
absolutely
necessary
right
now
but
its
one
of
the
things
people
wanted
to
help
book
contributors
Instead
of
editing
X
pages
only
the
main
page
of
the
book
needs
to
be
edited
Less
time
spent
worrying
about
organization
is
more
time
that
book
contributors
can
spend

So
one
could
in
theory
copy
over
the
information
from
the
book
shelf
page
onto
the
subject
page
leaving
the
automatically

below

not
necessarily
losing

That
would
be
inadvisable
as
subject
pages
were
designed
to
be
dynamically
generated
That
would
require
editing
subject
pages
themselves
every
time
a
book
s
status
is
changed
You
said
yourself
that
you
often
have
read
books
that
were
not
featured
so
whether
a
book
is
at
50
or
100
doesn
t
even
factor
into
the
decision
to
click
the
link
or
not
If
a
book
s
author
wants
to
indicate
its
progress
they
can
do
so
on
the
title
page
Listing
every
book
manually
on
the
subject
pages
would
be
no
different
than
moving
the
bookshelves
from
the
Wikibooks
namespace
to
the

unindent
Sure
you
d
like
that
information
before
the
level
of
clicking
on
the
book
As
an
editor
I
seek
out
books
on
the
list
the
need
improvement
and
I
look
down
the
list
for
things
that
are
around
50
complete
and
try
to
help
As
a
reader
I
search
for
things
that
are
further
along
since
I
probably
will
not
benefit
if
it
is
not
at
least
75
of
the
way
The
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
it
is
not
at
a
stage
I
am
interested
in
such
as
0
I
don
t
click
Not
to
mention
a
book
can
be
100
complete
and
not
worthy
of
being
featured
For
example
if
someone
shows
up
and
wants
to
read
about
algebra
they
may
either
end
up
looking
at
Mathematics
bookshelf
Algebra
or
Subject
Algebra
Which
is
more
helpful
I
would
say
the
Mathematics
bookshelf
currently
gives
you
some
idea
of
how
mature
the
books
are
what
level
of
reader
they
are
for
etc
I
am
not
trying
to
make
argue
we
should
keep
bookshelves
just
trying
to
get
people
to
talk
about
ideas
For
example
we
could
create
a
category
for
each
of
0
25
100
and
add
books
to
that
category
Also
I
believe
some
amount
of
manual
editing
of
subject
pages
might
be
necessary
I
thought
that
wasn
t
a
bad
thing
as
it
was
explained
to
me
the
point
of
moving
to
subjects
was
more
psychological
to
free
us
from
the
idea
that
books
had
to
be
on
one
and
only
one
bookshelf
etc
Weren
t
we
able
to
automatically
generate
lists
for
a
while
using
categories
Maybe
I
should
remind
myself
why
are
we
moving
from
bookshelves
to
Subjects
And
although
I
am
just
moaning
at
this
point
why
do
we
still
call
categories
subjects
in
the
links
at
the
bottom
of
pages
I
am
not
against
these
things
I
will
just
be
a
more
effective
editor
if
I
understand

can

To
modify
another
saying
development
stages
are
the
worst
of
all
possible
systems
until
you
look
at
what
else
is
available
Sure
the
system
has
faults
but
it
just
seems
like
we
are
scrapping
it
because
we
would
rather
not
think
about
a
method
for
implementing
it
on
subject
pages
Books
requiring
maintenance
is
nice
it
is
great
when
you
want
to
kill
some
spare
time
But
when
it
comes
to
books
I
can
realistically
contribute
content
to
I
am
only
interested
in
one
or
possibly
two
subjects
I
would
like
to
contribute
to
everything
but
I
am
not
able
to
Hence
lists
sorted
by
subject
are
helpful
The
same
is
true
when
one
is
looking
for
a
book
to
read
The
pages
you
point
to
get
to
be
unwieldy
Yes
some
books
will
always
be
mis
categorized
as
to
how
far
along
they
are
but
maintenance
tags
are
arguably
in
a
worse
state
of
affairs
Realistically
how
many
books
modules
that
need
to
be
expanded
have
a
tag
If
after
hard
work
we
had
every
module
tagged
appropriately
the
fore
mentioned
pages
would
be
very
difficult
to
sift
through
Perhaps
my
experience
is
skewed
but
many
books
I
look
at
have
no
tags
at
all
but
still
need
a
lot
of
work

I
kinda
like
the
idea
of
having
categories
for
completeness
Now
I
m
going
to
continue
the
brainstorming
read
that
as
I
m
about
to
propose
some
lunatic
ideas
Using
DPL
it
would
then
be
easy
to
sort
the
books
by
completeness
in
a
given
subject
Actually
I
ve
been
doing
this
with
chapters
in
Adventist
Youth
Honors
Answer
Book
for
maybe
two
years
now
but
it
s
a
binary
decision
an
honor
is
either
done
or
it
s
not
When
a
chapter
is
done
I
tag
it
with
Category
Adventist
Youth
Honors
Answer
Book
Completed
Honors
and
I
have
a
few
pages
that
sort
them
by
that
For
instance
Adventist
Youth
Honors
Answer
Book
Completed
Honors
Needing
Work
lists
chapters
that
have
instruction
for
teaching
enough
of
an
honor
that
it
could
be
awarded
but
the
honor
still
doesn
t
provide
instruction
for
meeting
every
optional
requirement
It
would
be
pretty
easy
to
create
a
template
that
transcluded
a
stage
icon
based
on
what
category
a
module
is
in
Maybe
percentages
are
the
wrong
metric
and
maybe
that
would
be
the
real
use
of
the
multi
dimensional
flagged
revs
settings
Not
suggesting
that
a
book
s
flagged
revs
setting
be
used
to
sort
the
books
but
rather
that
books
be
placed
in
categories
along
those
lines

Question
exclusive

transfer
of

I
have
a
question
about
the
transfer
of
my

I
looked
at

and
did
a
google
search
but
have
not
seen
the
answer
elsewhere
and
request
that
the
answer
be
added
to

My
question
is
this
when
I
transfer
my

copyright
work
into
Wikibooks
am
I
granting
to
the

Wikibooks
an
exclusive
or
non

right

copy

the
sense
described
in

Copyrights
Transfer
and

I
would
like
to
transfer
paragraphs
examples
from
other
documents
I
have
written
and
for
which
I
own
the
copyright
while
still
being
able
to
distribute
these
documents
possibly
in
large
numbers
or
for
money
without
inclusion
of
the
GFDL
If
I
am
transferring
an
exclusive
right
as
I
would
to
most
publishers
then
I
believe
I
would
have
to
live
within
the
GFDL
as
if
I
had
copied
the
material
from
Wikibooks
If
I
am
granting
a
non
exclusive
right
to
copy
then
I
can
still
do
what
I
like
with
my
pre
upload
copies
that
I
send
to
Wikibooks
even
sell
the
pre
uploaded
version
as
long
as
I
don
t
sell
an
exclusive
right
to
it
With
either
transfer
the
material
I
upload
can
be
edited
mercilessly
and
redistributed
at
will
which
is
fine
with
me
I
could
make
this
point
moot
by
just
re
creating
fresh
variants
of
the
examples
I
would
be
uploading
but
of
course
that
is
slower
and
my
time
is
valuable
Thanks
for
any
answer
you
can
provide
Apologies
in
advance
if
this
is
already
clearly
stated
somewhere

I
think
some
have
urged
that
people
should
be

include
images
of
themselves
on

and
shouldn

Personally
I
think
WB
HOST
applies
and
I
don
t
think
unlicensed
non

images
should
be
hosted
or
ignored
simply
because
they
are

I
recently
started
on
a
new
project
Wikijunior
Summer
Flowers
of
Northern
New
England
Having
taken
up
the
hobby
of
photographing
wildflowers
a
couple
of
years
ago
I
was
asked
to
put
together
a
small
pamphlet
for
a
children
s
program
which
will
take
place
at
the
end
of
this
month
Thanks
to
the
work
I
ve
done
over
on
the
v
Bloom
Clock
gathering
pictures
and
providing
text
for
all
the
flowers
that
bloom
around
my
stomping
grounds
will
not
be
a
problem
Getting
it
to
print
decently
will
be
though
at
least
for
me
I
m
planning
to
use
the
MediaWiki
collections
feature
but
right
now
it
s
breaking
my
tables
across
mutiple
pages
I
would
really
like
to
be
able
to
force
a
page
break
between
each
table
I
hacked
together
a
template
Template
WJ
Flower
for
this
project
so
any
page
break
stuff
would
be
easiest
there
I
guess
If
anyone
wants
to
pretty
up
my
template
a
bit
I
would
certainly
welcome
such
efforts
One
thing
I
still
want
to
do
is
use
the
color
field
to
paint
a
stripe
across
the
top
of
the
page
table
and
along
the
left
margin
Actually
I
will
need
the
stripe
on
the
left
margin
for
half
and
on
along
the
right
margin
for
the
other
half
Or
maybe
it
would
be
easier
to
do
both
then
I
can
rearrange
and
add
extra
flowers
without
re
justifying
the
margins
on
all
subsequent
pages
Are
page
breaks
even
possible
Should
I
be
looking
at
a
different
solution
Latex
I
don
t
have
time
for
that
learning
curve
Import
html
into
OpenOffice
and
then
fiddle
with
it
Any
help
is
greatly
appreciated

Just

you

have
to
add
a
chapter
in
the
collection
for
each

in

get

Making
each
plant
its
own
chapter
did
force
page
breaks
Unfortunately
the
output
is
still
not
what
I
m
looking
for
The
pdf
generator
insists
on
putting
the
full
page
name
at
the
top
of
each
chapter
Couple
that
with
the
WB
naming
policy
and
you
get
one
ugly
mess
It
s
also
making
some
chapter
cross
page
boundaries
in
awkward
places
and
overlapping
blocks
of
text
I
m
probably
going
to
import
this
into
OpenOffice
and
work
with
it
that
way
Or
maybe
Inkscape
I
dunno
It
sure
would
have
been
nice

be

As

it
the
hardcopies
from
PediaPress
are
produced
differently
with
manual

The
problems
with

Heya

Have

It
s
designed
so
that
you

me

the

of

The
author
moved
the
page
above
to
Fractals
Quaternion
Fractals
so
it
s
now
part
of
a
book
They
could
have
created
the
page
at
the
current
location
and
created
a
redirect
at
the
first
location
but
it
s
the
same
result
They
did
this
so
that
if
someone
types
quaternion
in
the
search
box
to
the
left
they
will
go
to
Quaternion
which
then
directs
them
to
the
relevant
page
in
the
Fractals
book
This
allows
the
use
of
Wikibooks
subpages
with
Wikipedia
ease
of
use
in
obtaining
information
on
a
subject
just
by
typing
it
in
the
box
The
only
time
this
doesn
t
work
is
if
two
books
cover
the
same
topic
Then
who
gets
the
use
of
the
prime
main
space
redirect
Hopefully
that
clarifies
what
was
being
done

of

created

some

such

would

The

caused
by
the
moves
qualify

once

Request
for
comments
I
had
recently
attempted
to
go
about
improving
the
Subject
page
for
Mathematics
My
idea
was
to
set
up
something
which
looked
a
bit
more
specialized
then
the
standard
template
which
many
of
the
subject
pages
have
No
offense
to
WhiteKnight
or
anyone
involved
with
creating
this
template
who
have
done
terrific
work
The
layout
of
the
mathematics
bookshelf
page
gives
a
rough
idea
about
how
advanced
various
mathematical
texts
are
I
thought
this
was
an
excellent
idea
and
wanted
to
do
something
similar
with
the
Subject
page
My
idea
was
to
set
up
categories
which
gave
books
based
on
the
difficulty
of
the
book
and
use
these
to
set
up
automatically
generated
lists
A
simple
mock
up
which
is
by
no
means
meant
to
be
complete
can
be
found

I

I

Darklama

I
have
been
deep
in
discussion
about
how
feasible
an
idea
this
was
This
may

The
conversation
starts
off
as
a

but
gets
more
peaceful
as
time
goes
on
We
have
seemed
to
reach
nearing
some
consensus
on
the
one
category
I
have
created
so
far
apart
from
the
proper
name
for
it
When
it
became
clear
that
I
intended
to
create
other
categories
Darklama
felt
I
had
gone
far
enough
and
I
should
involve
the
reading
room
before
creating
any
more
categories
That
about
gets
us
up

What

it

to

I
think

and
I
have
gotten
stuck
on
how
to

forward
Rather
then
leaving
the
situation
as
it
has

in

I
think
what
to
do

how

some
more

I
think
in
general
organizing
math
books
by
difficulty
is
going
to
be
difficult
to
achieve
I
think
this
is
why
this
approach
was
never
adopted
for
other
subjects
How
can
books
be
organized
by
difficulty
in
a
way
that
isn
t
dependent
on
how
a
specific
country
rates
a
subject
s
difficulty
or
a
person
s
personal
opinion
on
how
difficult
learning
a
specific
subject
is
I
can
understand
and
see
how
doing
so
could
be
useful
but
how
can
Wikibooks
make
it
useful
for
a
general
audience
or
so
it
is
useful
for
most
people

It
was
adopted
for
books
on
languages
using
Language
Learning
Difficulty
for
English
Speakers
to
file
them
in
subcategories
of
Category
Languages
by
category
This
was
not
difficult
however
as
the
differences
and
even
the
filing
of
specific
books
was
defined
by
an
outside
party
It
would
be
nice
if
there
were
an
outside
source
to
classify
mathematical

difficulty
wise
as
one

doing
it
will

That
book
also
admits
the
rankings
are
specific
to
a
specific
institute
in
the
US
and
that
many
people
may
disagree
with
a
language
s
ranking
So
even
the
difficulty
of
learning
a
language
is
tainted
by
nationality
I
think
it
would

on

Would
it
be
acceptable
to

too
Should
multiple
standards
to

instead
Should

this
may
be
redundant
because
of
an
edit
conflict
but
including
it
anyways
Perhaps
it
is
worth
playing
devil
s
advocate
and
pointing
out
that
it
is
not
clear
this
would
alleviate
all
of
Darklama
s
concerns
The
outside
party
that
created
this
list
of
difficulty
was
a
US
government
body
It
is
not
immediately
clear
to
what
extent
their
numbers
reflect
all
native
English
speakers
or
if
this
is
strongly
skewed
toward
Americans
To
quote
him
this
page
represents
how
a
specific
country
rates
a
subject
s
difficulty
My
question
would
be
should
we
get
rid
of
this
page
because
it
may
be
biased
And
should
I
not
attempt
to

Yes
to
what
extent
the

reflect
all
or
most
native
English

is
not
clear
Probably
the
only
way
to
ensure

is
to
ensure
that
whatever
approach
is
used
for
ranking
difficulty

is
backed
up
by

For
mathematics
I
would
think
that
rather
than
rating
by
difficulty
texts
should
be
rated
by
prerequisites
So
Algebra
should
not
be
attempted
until
Arithmetic
has
been
mastered
and
Calculus
should
not
be
attempted
before
Algebra
is
This
approach
would
eliminate
the
subjective
standards
In
my
experience
the
thing
that
makes
mathematics
difficult
is
a
poor
foundation
If
the
prerequisites
are
not
met
it
s
going
to
be
tough
going
It
might
still
be
tough
going
with
the
prerequisites
in
place
but
IMO
it
s
a
lot
easier
once
they
are
met
No
idea
how
to
translate
this
thought
into
a
wiki
structure
though

to

to

I
actually
like
the
idea
of
getting
the
books
to
state
more
clearly
what
the
prerequisites
are
There
are
a
few
subjects
where
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
story
Let
me
give
a
few
examples
of
what
I
think
issues
are
The
topic
of
algebra
at
the
moment
has
several
texts
at
various
levels
of
difficulty
These
books
would
have
the
same
set
of
prerequisites
but
it
may
be
useful
to
explain
which
is
geared
toward
a
more
advanced
audience
A
second
issue
is
that
many
subjects
do
not
have
clear
prerequisites
notice
the
books
here
may
disagree
with
me
on
this
point
Examples
here
might
include
Group
Theory
Topology
Formal
logic
Euclidean
Geometry
Any
mathematical
subject
that
starts
with
the
axioms
and
then
goes
forward
could
be
thought
of
as
facing
this
kind
of
issue
So
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
way
to
describe
if
a
book
is
written
for
elementary
school
students
or
college
students
If
such
a
range
seems
absurd
I
could
simply
point
to
Euclidean
Geometry
as
a
subject
that
has
books
at
every
level
The
Formal
Logic
book
handles
this
issue
by
stating
explicitly
at
the
beginning
it
is
for
a
college
level
audience
and
looking
through
the
book
I
agree
At
the
end
of
the
the
day
I
would
like
to
categorize
Formal
logic
that
way
I
should
point
out
though
that
Darklama
has
already
made
the
comment
that
this
sentence
is
inappropriate
and
should
be
removed
from
the
book
because
of
cultural
concerns
as
to
what
college
or
university
means
The
only
last
comment
I
would
make
about
prerequisites
is
that
we
should
probably
encourage
people
not
to
point
to
other
wikibooks
to
say
You
should
know
the
contents
of
this
book
On
the
one
hand
very
few
math
books
here
have
matured
enough
to
actually
cover
the
topics
they
intend
to
On
the
other
hand
books
also
go
through
very
drastic
overhauls
every
once
and
a
while
so
it
is
not
a
very
stable
piece
of
information
The
abstract
algebra
points
to
Linear
algebra
and
Algebra
as
things
one
should
know
before
starting
this
book
the
reader
may
be
left
wonder
what
exactly
it
is
he
or
she
should
know
Because
both
Algebra
and
Linear
Algebra
have
for
a
while
been
in
a
state
that
is
halfway
merged
with
other
books
and
are
not
particularly
readable
at
the
moment

I
am
doing
what
I
can

quickly
as
I

Difficulty
levels
aren
t
any
more
stable
due
to
books
being
overhauled
Books
can
also
start
with
Arithmetic
and
work
up
to
Trigonometry
or
some
other
branch
of
mathematics
or
touch
on
each
major
branch
of
mathematics
Such
books
might
have
varying
degrees
of
difficulty
The
mathematics
bookshelf
only
tries
to
make
a
distinction
between
introductory
books
and
higher
education
books
Consider
that
a
higher
education
book
could
also
be
introductory
Difficulty
levels
won
t
tell
you
why
a
book
is
considered
easy
or
hard
while
prerequisites
can
give
you
some
idea
of
why
you
may
have
difficulty
understanding
what
a
book
covers
and
can
point
readers
in
the
right
direction
I
think
it
would
be
far
more
useful
to
say

I
never
meant
to
imply
difficulty
levels
were
were
stable
under
major
overhauls
just
that
it
seems
a
bad
practice
to
use
the
books
here
to
describe
prerequisites
I
disagree
with
that
the
book
shelf
simply
has
two
categories
and
no
further
distinctions
The
subject
of
algebra
is
clearly
subdivided
between
elementary
and
intermediate
Perhaps
more
subtlety
is
the
sequence
that
books
appear
in
more
or
less
follows
the
usual
sequence
of
prerequisites
Let
me
state
more
explicitly
that
I
think
mathematics
texts
should
have
clearly
defined
prerequisites
I
agree
that
the
information
If
you
have
trouble
understanding
this
book
is
helpful
I
would
just
like
to
attempt
to
convey
this
information
in
a
clear
and
consistent
manner
And
as
I
stated
above
and
I
will
provide
article
references
if
you
desire
there
are
not
clear
prerequisites
for
every
subject
Furthermore
with
some
of
these
subjects
we
have
multiple
books
at
different
levels
Prerequisites
themselves
do
not
solve

Perhaps
it
would
be
difficult
Thankfully
some
of
the
work
categorizing
has
been
done

we
have

To
me
the

looks
like
people
have
tried
to
avoid
problems
or
controversy
by
avoiding
discussions
when
people

I
think
the

might
suffer

don
t

there
is
much
that

I
do

apathy

I
find
the

a
bit
insulting
I
was
around

fact

this

something
users
would

Instead
of
apathy
what
I
see
reflected
is
the
a
small
group
of
editors
whose
interest
was
not
piqued
by
the
suggestion

Probably

me
that

may
have
thrown

Prehaps

TextBox
Template
In
some
of
my
work
on
the
Linear
algebra
book
I
have
come
across
the
rather
annoying
problem
If
anyone
could
explain

this
happens
to
me
I
would
be
grateful
The

seems
to
respect
the

line
break
of
the
last
paragraph
but
no
other
To
explain
what
I
mean
in
the
two
text
boxes
below
there
are
two
paragraphs
the
first
paragraph
is
the
same
in
both
text
boxes
and
all
line
breaks
are
ignored
The
second
paragraph
on
the
first
text
box
is
contained
all
on
one
line
and
displays
correctly
In
the
second
text
box
there
are
many
line
breaks
but
only
the
one
that
occurs
between
the
bold
words
LINE
and
BREAK
appears
At
least
on
my
browser
Questions
I
have
Is
it
a
user
issue
meaning
am
I
doing
something
wrong
Is
this
dependent
on
browser
Is
there
a
nice
way
to
stop
that
line
break
from

I
ve
fixed
the
problem
with
the
template
The
problem
may
seem
odd
but
the
problem
was
that
the
closing
nowiki
div
nowiki
was
on
the
same
line
MediaWiki
is
suppose
to
suppress
paragraph
breaks
nowiki
p
p
nowiki
for
two
lines
of
text
without
any
intermediate
line
breaks
however
at
the
same
time
MediaWiki
is
also
suppose
to
put
paragraph
breaks
around
the
start
and
end
of
text
if
there
is
tag
while
trying
to
predict
if
that
is
appropriate
I
think
there
is
a
bug
because
its
suppose
to
suppress
a
paragraph
break
if
the
div
is
on
the
same
line
which
it
does
but
it
seems
to
be
depending
on
there
being
a
line
break
so
finds
the
previous
line
break
which
it
shouldn
t
do
and
puts
the
paragraph
break
there

Very
confused
while
trying
to
upload
image
I
ve
spent
bits
of
several
days
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
upload
and
make
use
of
an
image
in
a
wikibook
I
m
starting
specifically
Visualizing
Computation
I
have
learned
to
use
Inkscape
and
discovered
and
dealt
with
some
obscure
issues
such
as
why
you
don
t
want
to
have
a
non
integer
canvas
size
and
now
am
just
trying
to
install
the
image
on
the
wikimedia
commons
and
use
it
in
on
wikibooks
I
have
uploaded
an
https
secure
wikimedia
org
wikipedia
commons
wiki
File
Power
log
med
svg
image
to
wikimedia
commons
and
tried
to
refer
to
it
from
the
http
en
wikibooks
org
wiki
Visualizing
Computation
Memory
Evolution
Diagrams
appropriate
wikibooks
page
but
I
seem
to
be
getting
the
old
version
of
the
file
which
has
the
same
name
but
lives
on
wikibooks
instead
of
the
commons
Can
someone
please
a
take
a
look
at
the
wikibooks
page
and
tell
me
if
the
reference
is
being
done
in
the
right
way
and
also
b
delete
the
Power
log
med
svg
file
from
wikibooks
so
that
my
reference
will
reach
the
one
on
wikimedia
commons
telling
me
how
to
do
b
is
even
better
but
my
understanding
is
that
this
requires
administrator
access
note
that
I
m
planning
to
add
Visualizing
Computation
to
the
list
of
new
books
once
I
ve
got
at

one
good

that
I
do
seem
to

getting
the
current
version
of

Wikibooks
would
be
a
good
place
to
write
a
book
documenting
that
software
program
You
would
have
to
document
the
program
from
scratch
though
unless
the
person
or
persons
who
owns
the
copyright

the
help

agrees

Right
I
will
ask
them
about
this
Some
time
ago
Markus
gave
us
permission
to
use
screen
shots
of
GeoGebra
in
Wikimedia
projects
via
OTRS
for
example
this
one
File
Geogebra
png
Geogebra

So
maybe
they
can
also
extend
the
permission
for
Documentation
This
would
be
a
lot
better
than
start
the
book
from
scratch
By
the
way
how
to
delimit
when
such
a
wikibook
documenting
the
software
is
a
derivative
work
of
the
original
documentation
and
when
it
is
a
new
work
that
uses
that
documentation
as
reference

In
a
nutshell
Derivative
work
uses
previously
produced
content
references
are
used
when
a
few
snippets
of
content
phrases
are
used
in
the
resulting
work
or
to
give
credits
to
the
original
content
authors
if
the
new
work
is
build
on
ideas
concepts
or
discoveries
made
elsewhere
They
are
also
useful
to
provide
the
reader
with
other
related
sources
of
content
or
to
extend
the
usefulness
of
the
book
without
extensible
overlapping
previously
produced
content
that
doesn
t
fall
perfectly
in
the
scope
of
the

the

Please
note
that
there
is
current
development
of

changing
also
the

format
so
it
is
advisable
to
stall
work
on
this
document
until
the
file
format
stabilized
again
Overall
structure
A
wings
file
has
3
main
parts
1
Header
The
header
is
15
bytes
long
and
essentially
ASCII
formed
by
the
human
readeable
string
WINGS
1
0
followed
by
the
hex
bytes

n
Z
D
aka
CR
LF
SUB
and
EOT
Ctrl
Z
being
the
end
of
input
char
in
Windows
and
Ctrl
D
the
same
in
UNIX
2
Length
of
data
A
4
byte
unsigned
integer
giving
the
size
of
the
entire
file
stored
in
big
endian
format
This
value
should
match
the
size
of
the
file
on
disk
otherwise
the
file
is
missing
data

Data
The
main
part
of
the
file
in
Erlang

http
www
erlang
org
doc
apps
erts
erl
ext
dist
html
External
Term
Format
as
of
section
8
1
specifically
it
is
a
Zlib
compressed
term
as
indicated
by
the
first
two
bytes
131
80
The
next
4
bytes
thus
are
an
unsigned
integer
giving
the
size
of
the
uncompressed
data
The
rest
of
the
file
is
the
actual
compressed
data
term
When
processing
wings
files
with
Erlang
or
a
language
having
a
full
blown
interface
in
the
Erlang
distribution
exists
a
http

Java
interface
there
is
also
a
http

liu
se
tab
erlang
py
interface
Python
interface
elsewhere
you
just
feed
the
whole
data
part
to
the
appropriate
function
method
But
when
dealing
with
wings
files
in
some
other
language
these
6
bytes
might
be
seen
as
additional
header
information
the
rest
must
be
uncompressed
and
then
further
be
handled
to
reconstruct
the
nested
structure
of
the
term

impression

how

When
you
can

use
an

interface
or
want
to
write
a

one
you
have
to
know
the
external

which
is

very
well

here
Note
that
you
then
have
to
deal
with
a
stream
of
bytes
and
must
reconstruct
the
nested
structure
yourself
somehow
For
reference
the
Erlang
OTP
source
code
has
a
module
called
jinterface
that
gives
a
Java
implementation
of
a
set
of

that
can

Introduction
When
the
purchase
of
new
equipment
or
construction
exceeds
the
amount
of
10
000
a
school
district
must
purchase
the
equipment
through
a
competitive
public
bid
For
a
technology
director
a
bid
might
be
required
for
the
following
items
Creating
maintaining
and
Updating
Networks
Laptop
purchasing
for
school
buildings
Large
Scale
software
purchasing
Any
construction
associated
with
the
development
of
technology
infrastructure
The
bid
process
has
many
steps
and
can
last
for
4
to
6
months
from
creating
the
bid
to
final
school
board
approval
In
the
end
the
proposed
bid
will
go
to
the
lowest
bidder
that
meets
all
of
the
bid
specifications
The
bidding
process
is
dominated
by
detailed
specifications
that
aim
to
protect
the
school
district
and
potential
vendors
These
specifications
and
conditions
govern
every
aspect
of
bidding
from
creation
to
completion
While
bidding
is
an
important
part
of
a
Technology
Directors
position
it
is
becoming
less
frequently
used
for
hardware
purchases
due
to
state
contracts
or
cooperative
purchasing
agreements
such
as
PEPPM
and
CoStars
Bidding
is
still
an
essential
part
of
technology
construction
The
first
part
of
this
page
will
look
at
putting
together
a
bid
proposal
followed
by
alternate
ways
to
get
around
the
bid
process
The
following
information
is
a
general
guideline
for
the
bid
process
however
a
technology
director
would
need
to
look
into
specific
district
and
state
regulations
on
bidding

Step
1
Generating
the
Bid
Proposal
or
Bid
Spec
h5
Before
a
bid
can
be
created
a
school
district
needs
to
assess
their
needs
and
figure
out
what
equipment
will
work
best
in
their
situation
or
what
construction
is
required
There
are
many
ways
a
district
can
gather
this
information
A
need
can
be
identified
through
More
about
planning
can
be
found
in
Directing
Technology
Purchase
Faculty
interviews
Site
visits
to
other
schools
Administrative
request
Curriculum
needs
The
need
for
new
technology
or
construction
can
be
the
vision
of
a
few
people
or
the
need
of
the
whole
district
The
planning
process
is
especially
important
in
creating
specifications
for
a
bid
Specifications
are
the
specific
details
of
technology
or
construction
that
the
district
needs
At
the
end
of
the
bid
process
the
school
district
will
need
to
accept
the
lowest
submitted
bid
that
meets
all
the
outlined
specifications
so
it
is
imperative
that
the
specifications
outline
exactly
what
the
district
wants
On
the
other
end
the
district
cannot
become
so
specific
as
to
request
certain
brands
or
companies
In
the
specifications
the
school
district
will
also
need
to
outline
the
time
frame
for
the
bid
Specifications
are
a
reason
why
many
technology
departments
will
use
alternatives
discussed
below
to
bidding
for
the
purchase
of
hardware
If
specifications
are
too
general
a
district
might
end
up
with
an
inferior
product
that
does
not
meet
their
needs
or
if
the
specifications
are
too
specific
they
can
actually
drive
away
suitable
bidders

For
smaller
purchases
or
equipment
the
tech
director
might
write
the
bid
on
their
own
however
for
larger
items
or
construction
a
consultant
or
engineer
might
be
hired
to
assist
in
creating
the
specifications
This
can
assure
that
the
bid
accurately
reflects
the
needs
of
the
school
district
Specifications
can
range
from
memory
and
screen
size
in
the
purchase
of
laptops
to
the
specific
types
of
wires
and
jacks
used
in
construction
In
addition
to
creating
a
detailed
set
of
specifications
that
describe
the
item
or
service
needed
a
bid
should
also
include
Conditions
that
protect
the
school
district
during
the
bidding
purchasing
receiving
and
installation
process
These
Conditions
cover
everything
from
providing
clearly
marked
samples
to
completing
the
bid
in
the
given
time
specifications
to
what
documents
need
to
be
submitted
to
meet
the
bid
requirements
A
school
district
should
have
a
list
of
general
Conditions
for
the
bidding
procedure
however
individual
bids
may
have
special
conditions
that
are
unique

the
right

all
or
any
portion
of
the
bids
submitted
and
to
make
the
award
in
the
best
interest
of
the
School
District
The
Bidder
agrees
that
if
the
contract
is
awarded
to
him
he
will
not
assign
transfer
or
sublet
it
unless
specific
permission
to
do
so
is
granted
in
writing
by
the
School
District
The

to
furnish
and
deliver
the
said
items
at
such
times
at
such
places
and
in

In
the
end
the
lowest
qualified
bid
will
need
to
be
selected
A
technology
director
will
need
to
look
closely
at
whether
the
proposed
bids
meet
all
the
set
specifications
This
is
where
well
thought
out
and
detailed
specifications
can
make
or
break
a
bid
A
technology
director
cannot
choose
a
bid
based
on
a
preferred
brand
or
company
A
bid
can
only
be
selected
for
low
costs
and
meeting
bid
conditions
Reviewing
bids
is
a
complicated
task
and
depends
on
the
bids
submitted
and
the
quality
of
the
bid
specifications
The
final
decision
can
be
difficult
since
it
needs
to
ensure
the
district
receives
a
quality
product
or
service
that
meets
all
of
its
needs

also
meets

has

involved
parties
it
is
placed

board
agenda
for

approval
During
the
school
board
meeting
it
is
possible
that
further
discussion
about
the

selection
will
occur

process
the

Purchasing
or
Construction
h5
Upon
approval
of
the
bid
proposal
items
can
be
purchased
or
construction
can
begin
In
the
RFP
there
should
be
time
frames
for
the
completion
of
the
bid
Conditions
of
the
bid
will
outline
what
will
happen
if
a
vendor
or
contractor
cannot
meet
deadlines
or
bid
specifications
RFP
conditions
will
also
dictate
the
payment
for
items
or
services
by
the
school
district
The
entire
process
of
bidding
can
take
as
few
as
two
months
but
usually
lasts
up
to
six
Alternates
to
the
Bid
Process
Since
the
bid
process
can
be
complicated
and
may
not
yield
desired
results
there
are
alternatives
that
a
technology
director
might
want
to
consider
The
following
sites
work
best
for
the
purchase
of
technology
hardware
and
do
not
offer
the
best
alternative
to
technology
construction
Each
state
has
different
options
however
most
are
programs
that
have
pre
negotiated
prices
on
common
pieces
of
technology
Selected
vendors
submit
prices
for
items
and
those
prices
are
available
to
the
district
without
bidding
Some
programs
may
include
construction
costs
This
eliminates
the
need
for
a
bid
and
guarantees
the
district

Phases
of
the
design
process
This
chapter
discusses
the
different
phases
of
the
design
process
Please
note
that
the
design
process
is
not
black
and
white
but
gray
That
is
there
are
many
different
ways
to
get
to
a
design
and
there
most
certainly
is
no
ultimate
design
process
in
which
no
interpretation
or
intellect
is
necessary
These
discussions
give
you
an
idea
of
what
kind
of
information
is
necessary
in
which
phase
of
the
design
process
The
chapter
Embedded
Control
Systems
Design
Design
criteria
Design
Criteria
explains
the
approach
of
a
design
on
a
system
level
It
s
useful
to
read
this
chapter
first
before
you
read
further
on
Requirements
definition
Goal
of
this
phase
is
the
product
requirements
document
It
is
a
list
of
important
requirements
that
can
t
be
omitted
In
this
example
the
product
requirement
document
is
Railway
is
given
by
client
specifications
are
known
Lay
out
of
the
people
mover
is
1
locomotive
with
1
or
more
carriages
Vehicle
is
driven
by
electric
motor
Power
for
the
motor
comes
through
the
rails
The
railroad
needs
to
by
equipped
with
beacons
at
known
locations
Locomotive
is
equipped
with
a
beacon
sensor
Every
beacons
yields
its
own
reaction
3
kinds
of
reactions
exist
Speeding
up
with
a
certain
amount
Slowing
down
with
a
certain
amount
Stopping
with
a
given
deceleration
Safety
measures
Headlights
and
internal
illumination
must
switch
on
when
it
s
dark
A
control
tower
must
know
the
speed
and
position
of
the
people
mover
at
all
times
must
be
able
to
take
over
control
of
the
people
mover
when
necessary
System

Here
the
requested

of
the

is
described

Functional

are
necessary
in

Interaction
between
subsystems
The
system
can
be
divied
into
three
main
parts
Traffic
command
system
Control
command
system
wireless
communication
Vehicle
command
system
The
vehicle
command
system
can
be
divided
further
into
subsystems
In
the
end
it
leaves
a
total
of
7
subsystems
Wireless
communication
Implements
the
transfer
of
information
from
the
control
tower
to
the
train
and
vice
versa
CPU
Is
the
brain
of
the
people
mover
All
information
is
centralized
and
afterwards
divided
over
the
different
subsystems
Power
Is
responsible
fot
the
motor
its
management
system
Control
loop
Makes
the
control
loop
of
the
drive
Sensors
Gathers
information
of
the
environment
Mechanical
design
Esthetic
design
Figure

gives
a
schematic
overview
of
the
subsystems
The
interaction
between
the
different
subsystems
is
presented
in

2
Detailed
design
This
phase
results
in
a
concrete
structure
of
all
modules
from
which
the
system
must
be
made
The
functional
design
is
worked
out
on
the
component
level
After
this
phase
the
only
thing
left
is
the
implementaton
This
phase
can
be
thought
of
as
the
translation
of
the
functional
requirements
into
technical
specifications
Implementation
Building
and
testing
prototypes
of
the
system
Eventually
leading
to
the
production
model
This
phase
needs
no
further
explanation
Design
context
The
chapter
Embedded
Control
Systems
Design
Embedded
design
process
Design
contexts
Design
Contexts
explains
the
different
contexts
of
a
design
The
people
mover
is
either
a
from
scratch
environment
or
an
adapting
environment
depending
on
the
presence
of
a
previous
model
The
implications
of
a
certain
design
context
also
are
discussed
in
the
section

System

explains
the
different
categories
of
systems
as
a
function
of
their
complexity
as
well
as
the
definition
of
complexity
itself
Using
this
chapter
it
s
clear
that
the
people
mover
is
a
system
of
type
2
Distributed
hardware
Centralized
control
Perhaps
in
the
future
when
different
autonomous
people
movers
of
different
companies
all
use
the
same
railroad
system
the
necessity
of
distributed
control
becomes
obvious
and
this
system
of
systems
would
be
of
the
complexity
class
type

for

If
an

for
example
a
span
is
added
inside

it

assigned
height
100
vertical
align
middle
then
it
allows
to
precisely
get
what
we

a
line
box
with
the
desired
height
The
placeholder
element
is
given
100
height
to
prop
up
the
line
box
so
that
vertical
align
middle
has
the
desired
effect
This
will
avoid
the
need
for
the
aforementioned
IE
specific
relative
positioning
workaround
due
to
the
lack
of
cross
browser
support
for
display
table
compared
to
display
inline
block
If
the
content
is
a
block
element
add
display
inline
in
a
separate
declaration
for
IE6

Hmm
maybe

could
simply
be
merged
there
The
following
comment
has
no
importance
what
so
every
I
had
initially
thought
the
in
the
title
of
this
page
was
meant
to
indicate
that
screaming
was
a
subpage
of
a
book
on
growling
which
didn
t
actually
exists
But
I
notice
now
re
reading
these
pages
that
it
may
have
been
meant
more
as
the
usage
when
people
write
and

This
is
a
terrific
compilation
and
a
good
model
for
ABC
books
that
I
have
my
kindergarten
students
make
Just
two
of
the
flower
pictures
raised
questions
for
me
The
nasturtium
pictured
is
a
nasturtium
by
genus
but
its
common
name
from
what
I
discovered
on
several
websites
is
watercress
What
gardeners
know
as
nasturtium
is
in
the
genus
Tropaeolum
It
is
common
beloved
edible
and
would
make
more
sense
here
Similarly
and
this
is
more
of
a
quibble
yarrow
may
look
like
this
to
some
folks
but
most
of
us
think
of
it
as
white
or
yellow
This
is
my
first

logged

not

Main

stopped

time
as
well
Even
disregarding
the
limited
scope
of
a
book
on
Merrimack
New
Hampshire
election
results
there
are
only
two
pages
other
than
the
title
page
The
first
for
2002
is
an
outline
with
only
a
smidgen
of
information
filled
in
and
the
other
for
2005
is
a
tiny
stub
I
can
t
imagine
anyone
else
coming
along
to
document
information
that
is
of
such
a
limited
scope
Should
someone
really
need
to
know
who
was
elected
in
2002
2006
in
Merrimack
New
Hampshire
I
have
great
confidence
that
they
will
find
it
in
the

no

to

This

is
quite
ironic
given

said
before
his
death
to
get
them
out
of
the
Arabic
peninsula
on
the
Saudi
Arabia
page
does
nothing
to
further
that
goal
Given
the
content
on
the
pages
and
what
was

was

even
propose
that
this

would

Think
about
defining
a
proper
scope
of
the
book
first
taking
in
context
the
criticism
made
here
there
were
indeed
some
NPOV
issues
exposed
creating
unsubstantiated
list
of
issues
was
prone
to
raise
problems
and
then
advance
some
ideas
for
names

it
helps
create
an
area
on
your
userspace
to
build
up
the
content
in
a
way
that
when
you
add
it
to
the
book
it
doesn
t
become
objectionable
I
will
gladly
help
selecting
a
few
topics
that
would
like
to
see
covered
clarified
about
the
Islamic
culture
economics
the
banking
systems
for
instance
and
politics
the
differences
in
structure
from
occidental
democracies
Israel
and
USA
the
Palestinian
issue
terrorism
etc
there
are
many
interesting
subjects
that
could
be
covered
I
will
try
to
continue
to

to

This
assertion
is
incorrect
even
on
the
unrevised
version
it
was
a
stub
with
a
few
issues
on
the
NPOV
It
still
is
only
a
stub
and
the
NPOV
issues
seem
to
have
been
addressed

For
what
I
gather
from
the

this

and
what
makes
it
an
interesting
project
is
that
it
doesn
t
seem
to
be
only
about
the
religion
but
about
the
interaction
with
policies
and
social
cultural
aspects
around

from
an
Islamic
perspective
I

not

that
this

The
scope
of
the
book
seems
to
be
about
the
Islamic
perspective
it
only
becomes
bias
if
the
content
inhibits
impartial
judgment
from
the
reader
The
creator
of
the
project
is
willing
to
fix
the
problems
if
addressed
in
a

manner

the
issue
is
not
about
this

but
the

as
a

I
believe
the
point
is
that
covering
only
the
Islamic
perspective
when
the
book
title
is
God
s
Rights
makes
it
biased
There
is
the
Jewish
perspective
the
Christian
perspective
etc
to
what
God
s
Rights
are
too
There
are
two
possible
solutions
to
that
problem
Change
the
scope
of
the
book
with
the
intent
to
cover
every
religion
s
perspective
or
change
the
name
of
the
book
to
better
reflect
its
scope
and
audience
You
previously
suggested
the
book
should
be
renamed
and
the
only
contributor
seems
to
be
open
to
changing
the
name
so
that
solution
should
probably
be
done
Islam
In
The
World
Understanding
The
Islamic
World
and
Understanding
The
Rights
Of
Islamics
would
all
probably
better
reflect
the
scope
of
the
book
Even
with
that
the
book
would
need
to
be
sure
not
to
limit
itself
to
only
one
Islamic
faction

keep

per
Panic
s
suggestion
It
appears
this
is
more
of
an
analysis
of
countries
organizations
and
people
against
the
Koran
s
teachings
As
stated
by
Darklama
this
book
will
be
treading
a
thin
line
on
NPOV
unless
it
takes
on
all
of
the
Muslim
views
not
just
author
s
view
interpetation
of
the
Koran
It
appears
the
contributor
is
foreign
so
the
ability
to
properly
articulate
a
NPOV
may
be
hampered
The

can
assist

the

of
the

There
are
some
unbalanced
points
but
the
book
is
being
watched
very
carefully
here
since
it
was
VFD
the
issues
it
raises
and
the
need
to
clarify
them
makes
it
well
worth
the
trouble
this
subject
is
very
prone
to
ruffle
some
feathers
but
the
scope
of
the
book
is
very
interesting
and
any
lingering
issues
are
due
mostly
because
of

Loops
R
provides
three
ways
to
write
loops
for
repeat
and
while
The
tt
for
tt
statement
is
excessively
simple
You
simply
have
to
define
index
here
k
and
a
vector
in
the
example
below
the
vector
is
1
5
and
you
specify
the
action
you
want
between
braces

for
k
in
1

print

pre
When
it
is
not
possible
to
use
the
for
statement
you
can
also
use
break
or
while
by
specifying
a
breaking
rules
One
should
be
careful
with
this
kind
of
loops
since
if
the
breaking
rules
is
misspecified
the
loop
will
never
end
In
the
two
examples
below
the
standard
normal
distribution
is
drawn
in
as
long
as
the
value
is
lower
than
1

Standard
linear
model
In
this
section
we
present
estimation
functions
for
the
standard
linear
model
estimated
by
ordinary
least
squares
OLS
Heteroskedasticity
and
endogeneity
are
treated
below
The
main
estimation
function
is
tt
lm
tt
Fake
data
simulations
We
first
generate
a
fake
dataset
such
that
there
is
no
hetereoskedasticity
no
endogeneity
and
no
correlation
between
the
error
terms
Therefore
the
ordinary
least
square
estimator
is
unbiased
and
efficient
We
choose
a
model
with
two
variables
and
take
all
the
coefficients
equal
to
one

Syntax
The
main
idea
is
that
you
write
a
file
which
includes
LaTeX
and
R
code
LaTeX
code
begins
with
tt
tt

R
code

The
file
is
stored
with
extension
tt

tt
or
tt

At
the
end
you
extract
from
this
file
an
R
file
using
tt
Stangle
tt
and
a
LaTeX
file
using
tt
Sweave
tt
Here
is
an
example
with
a
file
called

Note
that
you
may
need
to
download
Sweave
sty
from
the
internet
since
it
is
not

options
These
options
can

either
include

in
the
tex

using
tt
fig

tt
or
not
include
them
using
tt

F
tt
By
default
figures
are

If
you
only
want
one
format
suppress

one
with

The

If

Introduction
Maximum
likelihood
estimation
is
just
an
R
Programming
Optimization
optimization
problem
You
have
to
write
down
your
log
likelihood
function
and
use
some
optimization
technique
Sometimes
you
also
need
to
write
your
score
the
first
derivative
of
the
log
likelihood
and
or
the
hessian
the
second
derivative
of
the
log
likelihood
One
dimension
If
there
is
only
one
parameter
we
can
optimize
the
log
likelihood
using
code
optimize
code
Example
with
a
type
1
Pareto
distribution
We
provide
an
example
with
a
type
1
w
Pareto
distribution
Pareto
distribution
Note
that
in
this
example
we
treat
the
minimum
as
known
and
do
not
estimate
it
Therefore
this
is
a
one
dimensional
problem
We
use
the
code
rpareto1
code
actuar
function
to
generate
a
random
vector
from
a
type
1
Pareto
distribution
with
shape
equal
to
1
and
minimum
value
equal
to
500
We
use
the
code
dpareto1
code
actuar
function
with
option
code
log
TRUE
code
to
write
the
log
likelihood
Then
we
just
need
to
use
code
optimize
code
with
code

code
We
provide
a
minimum
and
a
maximum
value
for

Example
with

distribution
For
instance
we
can
write
a
simple
maximum
likelihood
estimator
for
a
Cauchy
distribution
using
the
tt
nlm
tt
optimizer
We
first
draw
a
vector

from
a
Cauchy
distribution
Then
we
define
the
log
likelihood
function
and
then
we
optimize
using
the
tt

Attaching
data
One
of
the
big
advantage
of
R
over
Stata
is
that
you
can
deal
with
multiple
datasets
at
the
same
time
You
just
need
to
specify
the
name
of
the
dataset
and
a
symbol
before
each
variable
name
for
instance
code

code
and

don
t
want
to

again

Detecting
duplicates
When
you
want
to
clean
up
a
data
set
it
is
very
often
useful
to
check
if
you
don
t
have
the
same
information
twice
in
the
data
R
provides
some
functions
to
detect
duplicates
code
duplicated
code
looks
at
duplicated
elements
and
return
a
logical
vector
You
can
use
code

this
vector

Creating
a
subset
of
the
data
One
can
subset
the
data
using
code
subset
code
The
first
argument
is
the
name
of
the
dataset
the
second
argument
is
a
logical
condition
which
say
which
lines
will
be
included
in
the
new
dataset
and
the
last
argument
is
the
list
of
variable
which
will
be
included
in
the
new
dataset
In
the
following
example
we
generate
a
fake
dataset
and
we
use
the
code

to

the

in
order
to

is
possible
to

own
function
The
idea
is
simple
We
create
a
vector
which
igives
for
each
line
the
number
of
times
it
should
be
replicated
dups
in
the
following
example
Then
we
use
the
code
rep
code
function
to
create
a
vector
which
repeats
the
line
numbers
according
to
what
we
want
The
last
step
creates
a
new
dataset
which
repeats
lines
according
to
the
desired
pattern

it
and
choose
a

Once
you
have
installed
R
you
may
want
to
choose
a
working
environment
This
can

such
as

Installing
R
on
Debian
based
GNU
Linux
distributions
e
g
Ubuntu
or

itself
is
as
simple
as
to
type
in
code
sudo

code
or
code
sudo
apt

don

or
installing
the

code
r
base
code
using
your
favourite
package
manager
for
example
Synaptic
There
is
also
a

to
different
purposes
Their
names
begin
with
code

Take
a
closer
look
at
the
package
code
r
recommended
code
It
is
a
metapackage
that
depends
on
a
set
of
packages
that
are
recommended
by
the
upstream
R
core
team
as
part
of
a
complete
R
distribution
It
is
possible
to
install
R
by
installing
just
this

from
where
you
could
download
the
required
content
The
best
idea
is
pick
a

other
ones
should
work
as
well

up
to
you
which

Please
note
that
the

you
have
to

Quantile
regression
is
a
very
old
method
which
has
become
popular
only
in
the
last
years
thanks
to
computing
progress
One
of
the
main
researcher
in
this
area
is
also
a

and
has
developped
a

Introduction
Wikipedia
Factor
analysis
is
a
set
of
techniques
to
reduce
the
dimensionality
of
the
data
The
goal
is
to
describe
the
dataset
with
a
smaller
number
of
variables
ie
underlying
factors
Factor
Analysis
was
developed
in
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century
by
L
L
Thurstone
and
others
Correspondence
analysis
was
originally
developed
by
w
Jean
Paul
Benz
cri
Jean
Paul
Benz
cri
in
the
60
s
and
the
70
s
Factor
analysis
is
mainly
used
in
marketing
sociology
and
psychology
It
is
also
known
as
data
mining
multivariate
data
analysis
or
exploratory
data
analysis
There
are
three
main
methods
Principal
Component
Analysis
deals
with
continuous
variables
Correspondence
Analysis
deals
with
a
contingency
table
two
qualitative
variables
and
Multiple
correspondence
analysis
is
a
generalization
of
the
correspondence
analysis
with
more
than
two
qualitative
variables
The
major
difference
between
Factor
Analysis
and
Principal
Components
Analysis
is
that
in
FA
only
the
variance
which
is
common
to
multiple
variables
is
analysed
while
in
PCA
all
of
the
variance
is
analysed
Factor
Analysis
is
a
difficult
procedure
to
use
properly
and
is
often
misapplied
in
the
psychological
literature
One
of
the
major
issues
in
FA
and
PCA
is
the
number
of
factors
to
extract
from
the
data
Incorrect
numbers
of
factors
can
cause
difficulties
with
the
interpretation
and
analysis
of
the
data
There
are
a
number
of
techniques
which
can
be
applied
to
assess
how
many
factors
to
extract
The
two
most
useful
are
parallel
analysis
and
the
minimum
average
partial
criterion
Parallel
analysis
works
by
simulating
a
matrix
of
the
same
rank
as
the
data
and
extracting
eigenvalues
from
the
simulated
data
set
The
point
at
which
the
simulated
eigenvalues
are
greater
than
those
of
the
data
is
the
point
at
which
the
correct
number
of
factors
have
been
extracted
The
Minimum
Average
Partial
criterion
uses
a
different
approach
but
can
often
be
more
accurate
Simulation
studies
have
established
these
two
methods
as
the
most
accurate
Both
of
these
methods
are
available
in
the
tt
psych
tt
package
under
the
tt
fa
parallel
tt
and
the
tt
VSS
tt
commands
Another
issue
in
factor
analysis
is
which
rotation
if
any
to
choose
Essentially
the
rotations
transform
the
scores
such
that
they
are
more
easily
interpretable
There
are
two
major
classes
of
rotations
orthogonal
and
oblique
Orthogonal
rotations
assume
that
the
factors
are
uncorrelated
while
oblique
rotations
allow
the
factors
to
correlate
but
do
not
force
this
Oblique
rotations
are
recommended
by
some
e
g
MacCallum
et
al
1999
as
an
orthogonal
solution
can
be
obtained
from
an
oblique
rotation
but
not
vice
versa
One
of
the
issues
surrounding
factor
analysis
is
that
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
rotations
which
explain
the
same
amount
of
variance
so
it
can
be
difficult
to
assess
which
model
is
correct
In
response
to
such
concerns
Structural
Equation
Modelling
SEM
which
is
also
known
as
Confirmatory
Factor
Analysis
CFA
was
developed
by
Joreskeg
in
the
1970
s
The
essential
principle
of
SEM
is
that
given
a
model
it
attempts
to
reproduce
the
observed
covariance
matrix
seen
in
the
data
The
ability
of
a
model
to
reproduce
the
data
can
be
used
as
a
test
of
that
model
s
truth
SEM
is
implemented
in
R
in
the
tt
sem
tt
and
tt
lavaan
tt
packages
as
well
as
the
OpenMx
package

The

of
a

can
be
modeled
as
a
discrete
event
system
DES
The
behaviour
of
these
systems
is
governed
by
discrete
events
occurring
asynchronously
over
time
To
model
this
discrete
behaviour
one
can
use
Finite
State
Machines
FSM
or
Petri
Nets
PN
FSM
are
used
where
the

Descrete
Event
System
Properties
This
section
handles
the
general
properties
of
discrete
event
systems
Discrete
In
nature
everything
is
a
continuous
process
When
modelling
a
system
with
a
discrete
event
system
one
assumes
that
certain
behaviour
doesn
t
change
through
time
This
constant
behaviour
is
represented
by
a
state
Asynchronous
nature
Because
FSM
and
PN
are
discrete
models
time
isn
t
measured
Consequently
one
doesn
t
know
how
long
a
transition
from
one
state
to
another
takes
Only
the
order
of
event
occurrence
is
important
In
reality
transitions
take
time
so
during
a
transition
the
system
will
be
in
an
undefined
state
because
instantaneous
transitions
are
assumed
These
timing
aspects
can
be
modelled
but
this
makes
the
model
more
complex
and
harder
to
understand
Deadlocks
When
modelling
distributed
systems
one
must
taken
account
for
the
occurrence
of
never
being
able
to
fire
a
transition
because
there
are
no
tokens
left
to
fill
the
empty
transition
inputs
because
alle
other
tokens
are
also
waiting
on
a
transition
This
situation
of
mutual
waiting
is
called
a
deadlock
Uninterpreted
model
The
states
and
transitions
in
FSM
and
PN
are
labeled
with
statements
These
labels
make
clear
what
the
state
represents
and
what
fysical
condition
will
trigger
an
transition
If
one
would
change
the
name
of
these
labels
this
wouldn
t
affect
the
execution
of
the
models
That
s
why
PN
and
FSM
are
uninterpreted
The
same
FSM
or
PN
can
describe
many
systems
Hierarchy
Every
FSM
can
be
a
sub
FSM
of
another
bigger
FSM
The
same
is
true
for
PN
The
sub
FSM
is
represented
by
a
separate
state
while
a
sub
PN
is
replaced
by
one
transition
or
one
place
Hierarchy
makes
a
model
better
to
understand
Design
lessons
From
the
previous
properties
one
can
derive
some
design
rules
These
are
summarised
in
this
section
General
When
designing
the
coordination
of
a
system
as
a
discrete
event
system
one
should
always
keep
the
timing
aspects
in
mind
Transitions
in
DES
take
no
time
at
all
in
contrast
to
real
life
Outputs
could
for
example
take
some
time
to
emerge
and
neglecting
this
could
make
your
model
behave
in
an
unpredictable
way
Always
model
time
when
it
s
an
important
property
of
your
system
Other
concerns
are
the
starting
up
and
the
shutting
down
behaviour
Often
FSM
and
PN
are
represented
as
if
they
never
have
to
boot
up
or
to
shut
down
while
real
life
systems
do
encounter
these
conditions
Neglecting
these
conditions
can
cause
the
system
to
behave
unpredictable
and
maybe
even
hazardous
The
start
and
end
procedures
could
be
modelled
as
a
separated
FSM
or
PN
Always
use
a
hierarchical
structure
to
clearify
your
design
With
hierarchy
it
is
also
easy
to
model
starting
and
ending
Starting
for
example
is
a
state
of
a
system
When

Moore

The
most
simple
model
to
understand
and
to
program
is
the
Moore
model
The
exit
actions
of
the
Mealy
model
should
be
treated
as
an
auxiliary
feature
to
simplify
design
or
to
reduce
the
number
of
states
This
way
you
ll
get
a
mixed
model
of
both
Moore
and

structure
However
be
careful
to
mix
synchronous

From
experience
it

that
this
can

There
are
many

Usage
of
Scottish
Gaelic
Past
usage
Prior
to
the
Statutes
of
Iona
and
the
religious
Reformation
in
the
sixteenth
century
Gaelic
was
the
main
spoken
language
of
the
northwest
half
of
Scotland
and
Lowland
Scots
was
the
main
spoken
language
of
the
southeast
half
of
Scotland
From
around
that
time
up
until
relatively
recent
times
successive
governments
sought
to
discourage
the
use
of
Gaelic
and
the
language
went
into
decline

Scottish
Reformation
Present
day
usage
By
the
1970s
the
Gaelic
language
was
largely
confined
to
the
northwest
islands
of
Scotland
but
most
families
in
the
Western
Isles
continued
to
use
it
as
part
and
parcel
of
everyday
family
life
Since
then
many
families
in
the
Western
Isles
have
stopped
speaking
in
Gaelic
and
many
parents
there
are
no
longer
passing
their
native
language
on
to
their
children
Many
Gaelic
speakers
have
great
difficulty
in
understanding
some
Gaelic
radio
programmes
especially
news
and
current
affairs
programmes
because
their
knowledge
of
Gaelic
vocabulary
is
to
some
extent
limited
Additionally
many
Gaelic
words
have
fallen
into
relative
disuse
and
Gaelic
speakers
often
cannot
understand
all
of
the
words
in
traditional
poems
and
songs
without
the
aid
of
a
dictionary
A
large
percentage
of
Gaelic
speaking
people
are
relatively
speaking
socially
isolated
from
fellow
Gaelic
speakers
and
seldom
have
the
opportunity
to
make
use
of
their
skill
in
Gaelic
Many
Gaelic
speaking
people
live
outside
of
the
Gaelic
speaking
areas
such
as
in
the
cities
for
example
and
in
such
areas
the
social
networks
of
Gaelic
speaking
people
are
relatively
poor
Recently
however
the
government
and
the
education
system
have
become
more
favourable
towards
Gaelic
and
some
schools
in
Scotland
offer
to
educate
children
in
Gaelic
Many
of
the
children
in
Gaelic
schools
and
Gaelic
units
within
schools
however
tend
to
confine
their
use
of
Gaelic
to
school
hours
and
tend
to
speak
English
at
home
particularly
in
families
which
are
not
in
frequent
contact
with
other
Gaelic
speaking
families
Although
more
people
are
now
learning
Gaelic
and
attitudes
towards
the
Gaelic
language
are
gradually
improving
relatively
few
learners
of
Gaelic
are
achieving
fluency
As
a
result
very
few
learners
of
Gaelic
are
passing
the
language
on
to
their
children
or
grandchildren

Looking
to
the
future
Recently
the
government
set
up
a
department
in
Scotland
called
B
ograve
rd
na
G
agrave
idhlig
whose
responsibility
is
to
encourage
the
increased
use
of
Gaelic
B
ograve
rd
na
G
agrave
idhlig
has
laid
a
strong
emphasis
on
consultation
with
the
Gaelic
speaking
population
giving
some
room
for
optimism
for
the
future
continued
use
of
the
language
Understanding
the
signs
indicating
whether
the
language
is
likely
to
recover
and
increase
in
usage
is
a
complicated
matter
and
requires
a
good
understanding
of
the
principles
of
language
revival
see
Wikipedia
language
revival
While
it
has
to
be
said
that
a
high
proportion
of
Gaelic
speakers
are
now
socially
isolated
from
other
Gaelic
speakers
giving
them
few
opportunities
to
avail
themselves
of
their
skill
in
the
language
there
are
increasing
opportunities
to
learn
Gaelic
and
some
of
the
Gaelic
learning
groups
and
societies
encourage
learners
of
Gaelic
to
speak
in
Gaelic
as
much
as
possible
in
order
to
make
the
learners
feel
more
comfortable
when
speaking
Gaelic
In
recent
years
there
was
a
tendency
at
Gaelic
arts
festivals
for
people
to
speak
in
English
rather
than
Gaelic
For
instance
prizegiving
at
M
ograve
d
competitions
started
to
become
conducted
in
English
rather
than
Gaelic
In
recent
festivals
however
it
is
said
that
the
usage
of
spoken
Gaelic
has
increased
again
and
that
some
of
these
festivals
are
becoming
once
again
social
occasions
where
people
are
encouraged
to
use
the
language
not
only
in
poetry
and
song
recital
but
in
general
conversation
as
well
With
such
mixed
indications
it
seems
that
the
future
of
the
Gaelic
language
hangs
very
much
in
the
balance
Sustainability
In
our
world
where
English
is
used
and
understood
by
roughly
a
quarter
of
its
entire
population
it
is
becoming
increasingly
the
case
that
local
languages
such
as
Gaelic
can
subsist
alongside
global
languages
such
as
English
without
one
negating
the
importance
of
the
other
Indeed
the
use
of
English
has
increased
enormously
in
recent
years
despite
the
fact
that
as
a
proportion
of
the
world
s
population
its
number
of
mother
tongue
speakers
is
actually
decreasing
Global
languages
facilitate
international
communication
and
business
while
local
languages
provide
community
cohesion
social
stability
and
confidence
as
well
as
access
to
local
forms
of
literature
and
culture
A
global
language
and
a
local
language
can
live
side
by
side
provided
they
are
each
given
specific
roles
or
niches
and
provided
each
are
afforded
due
respect
Providing
people
with
adequate
opportunities
to
learn
both
a
local
and
a
global
language
and
ensuring
that
such
persons
can
be
given
the
opportunity
to
be
well
integrated
into
the
societies
that
use
these
languages
is
in
my
view
a
small
price
to
pay
for
securing
the
personal
social
and
economic
benefits
of
being
sustainably
and
confidently
bilingual
The
global
and
the
local
both
matter
and
language
is
part
and
parcel
of
each
Making
Gaelic
sustainable
The
number
of
people
with
an
ability
to
speak
read
or
write
Scottish
Gaelic
has
declined
in
the
past
few
centuries
and
the
number
is
now
well
under
50
000
Many
of
the
people
who
are
able
to
speak
Gaelic
are
not
in
the
habit
of
using
it
and
many
Gaelic
speaking
parents
are
not
in
the
habit
of
speaking
in
Gaelic
to
their
children
Many
of
those
who
are
able
to
speak
Gaelic
are
scattered
and
effectively
isolated
from
other
Gaelic
speakers
and
they
seldom
obtain
opportunities
to
avail
themselves
of
their
skill
in
Gaelic
There
are
also
few
occasions
or
situations
where
people
are
positively
encouraged
or
required
to
use
Gaelic
In
addition
some
Gaelic
speaking
people
have
a
negative
attitude
towards
their
language
and
prefer
not
to
make
use
of
their
ability
to
speak
it
and
discourage
others
from
speaking
it
too
This
raises
long
term
questions
about
the
sustainability
of
the

Advantages
of
being
able
to
communicate
in
more
than
one
language
For
the
purposes
of
making
a
lesser
used
language
sustainable
it
is
probably
helpful
for
people
to
be
aware
of
the
benefits
of
being
able
to
communicate
in
more
than
one
language
There
are
several
advantages
in
being
able
to
communicate
in
more
than
one
language
It
broadens
a
person
s
experiences
provides
cognitive
advantages
and
provided
each
of
the
person
s
languages
are
afforded
due
respect
can
contribute
to
a
person
s
self
esteem
and
confidence
People
who
are
able
to
communicate
well
in
more
than
one
language
can
have
a
greater
breadth
of
experiences
and
often
a
greater
tolerance
of
cultural
differences
A
person
who
is
communicative
in
more
than
one
language
is
often
accepting
of
those
who
are
culturally
different
and
is
often
welcoming
of
those
who
speak
other
languages
and
have
different
customs
People
who
are
fluent
in
more
than
one
language
get
to
know
which
language
to
use
with
which
person
in
which
situation
Through
this
experience
they
appear
to
learn
how
to
be
more
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
listeners
than
people
who
can
only
communicate
in
one
language
People
who
can
read
and
write
in
more
than
one
language
are
able
to
enjoy
two
or
more
literatures
opening
up
different
literary
traditions
ideas
ways
of
behaving
and
ways
of
thinking
The
pleasures
of
reading
poems
novels
and
magazines
and
the
enjoyment
of
writing
to
relatives
and
friends
are
all
increased
for
people
who
have
the
ability
to
communicate
proficiently
in
more
than
one
language
Where
parents
have
different
preferred
languages
children
learn
how
to
communicate
in
each
parent
s
language
This
can
allow
a
close
and
special
relationship
with
each
parent
to
develop
Having
two
or
more
words
for
every
object
and
idea
can
be
an
advantage
to
creativity
Sometimes
corresponding
words
in
different
languages
have
different
associations
or
connotations
When
slightly
different
associations
are
attached
to
each
word
the
person
with
two
or
more
languages
may
be
able
to
think
more
creatively
Reversing
language
shift
Joshua
Fishman
proposes
an
eight
stage
model
for
reversing
language
shift
and
recommends
that
efforts
should
concentrate
on
the
earlier
stages
until
they
have
been
consolidated
before
proceeding
to
the
later
stages
The
eight
stages
are
as
follows
Acquisition
of
the
language
by
adults
who
may
effectively
act
as
language
apprentices
recommended
where
most
of
the
remaining
speakers
of
the
language
are
elderly
and
socially
isolated
from
other
speakers
of
the
language
Create
a
socially
integrated
population
of
active
speakers
of
the
language
thereby
creating
a
community
of
people
who
use
the
language
frequently
at
this
stage
it
is
usually
best
to
concentrate
mainly
on
the
spoken
language
rather
than
the
written
language
In
localities
where
there
are
a
reasonable
number
of
people
habitually
using
the
language
encourage
the
informal
use
of
the
language
among
people
of
all
age
groups
and
within
families
and
bolster
its
daily
use
through
the
establishment
of
local
neighbourhood
institutions
in
which
the
language
is
encouraged
protected
and
in
certain
contexts
at
least
used
exclusively
At
this
stage
it
may
be
useful
for
speakers
to
be
aware
of
the
personal
advantages
of
being
bilingual
In
areas
where
oral
competence
in
the
language
has
been
achieved
in
all
age
groups
encourage
literacy
in
the
language
but
in
a
way
that
does
not
depend
upon
assistance
from
or
goodwill
of
the
state
education
system
Where
the
state
permits
it
and
where
numbers
warrant
encourage
the
use
of
the
language
in
lieu
of
compulsory
state
education
at
this
stage
it
may
be
useful
for
speakers
of
the
language
to
be
aware
of
the
benefits
of
bilingual
education
Where
the
above
have
largely
been
achieved
encourage
the
use
of
the
language
in
the
workplace
lower
worksphere
Where
the
above
have
largely
been
achieved
encourage
use
of
the
language
in
local
government
services
and
mass
media
Where
the
above
have
largely
been
achieved
encourage
use
of
the
language
in
higher
education
government
etc
This
model
of
language
revival
seeks
to
avoid
conflict
and
is
intended
to
direct
efforts
to
where
they
are
most
effective
and
to
avoid
wasting
energy
trying
to
achieve
the
later
stages
of
language
revival
when
the
earlier
stages
have
not
been
achieved
For
instance
it
is
probably
wasteful
of
effort
to
work
on
the
later
stages
of
language
revival
if
few
families
are
in
the
habit
of
using
the
language
among
themselves

What
is
theology
Human
beings
are
essentially
social
animals
Social
animals
operate
in
groups
packs
or
tribes
Usually
individuals
are
linked
by
family
connections
to
an
alpha
male
who
provides
tactical
leadership
Provided
this
leadership
increases
the
probability
of
success
for
individual
members
as
well
as
for
himself
he
will
earn
respect
Humans
uniquely
have
the
ability
to
formulate
long
term
strategic
plans
and
communicate
complex
ideas
which
has
made
our
species
the
most
successful
of
all
living
creatures
on
this
planet
Leadership
is
crucial
to
human
success
The
model
of
parental
superiority
is
implicit
from
birth
as
the
infant
human
is
incapable
of
independent
survival
A
hierarchical
chain
of
command
with
delegated
responsibilities
and
privileges
thus
emerged
naturally
and
early
in
human
history
Ancestor
worship
is
a
form
of
hierarchical
deference
to
wise
but
dead
former
leaders
Death
Theories
about
what
happens
after
death
if
there
is
a
human
spirit
or
soul
capable
of
surviving
the
body
is
important
to
people
Should
former
leaders
influence
their
survivors
Is
there
somewhere
an
unseen
community
of
the
dead
or
some
sort
of
super
spirit
capable
of
communicating
with
the
living
These
ideas
matter
because
people
believe
in
these
theories
and
those
beliefs
true
or
false
do
indeed
alter
our
behavior
according
to
the
expected
reward
or
punishment
A
trader
trades
with
the
expectation
to
be
paid
fairly
If
not
then
a
higher
authority
either
the
police
or
the
judiciary
will
be
expected
to
apply
influence
A
religious
person
may
give
alms
or
take
up
arms
without
expectation
of
any
earthly
benefit
expecting
instead
a
good
feeling
now
followed
by
a
certain
reward
in
heaven
Life
Most
religions
use
the
external
influence
of
unseen
forces
to
mold
habits
that
led
to
successful
survival
War
is
a
human
strategic
invention
that
allows
the
winning
side
to
take
the
riches
of
the
losers
who
may
be
killed
or
enslaved
War
is
dangerous
for
individuals
but
not
for
armies
or
communities
as
a
whole
as
long
as
they
are
successful
defenders
or
colonizers
Individual
warriors
have
to
be
assured
they
will
receive
their
reward
at
the
close
of
battle
or
else
in
the
afterlife
if
they
are
brave
and
do
as
they
are
told
without
question
The
corollary
is
that
if
a
warrior
is
cowardly
or
disobedient
he
will
first
be
be
killed
and
tormented
in
the
afterlife
The
purpose
of
Religion
The
origin
of
theology
is
uncertain
but
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
evolved
for
the
nurture
of
children

A
society
that
is
able
to
breed
successfully
may
need
to
steal
from
outsiders
and
enslave
foreigners
merely
to
survive
In
so
doing
it
is
likely
to
accumulate
power
and
worldly
wealth
which
may
be
attractive
predatory
competitors
The
same
is
true
of
criminal
gangs
and
nation
states
The
successful
strategy
is
therefore
to
distinguish
right
and
wrong
behavior
between
us
within
a
group
and
them
our
potential
victims
As
human
societies
became
more
complex
the
definitions
of
who
was
inside
warriors
certainly
but
what
about
children
wives
slaves
friendly
tribes
as
well
as
the
context
in
which
right
and
wrong
might
be
judged
and
rewarded
or
punished
became
a
problem
requiring
study
and
the
evolution
of
clear
rules
which
we
call
theology
When
may
a
warrior
legally
kill
What
is
just
cause
war
as
distinguished
from
a
criminal
enterprise
Types
of
religion
Religions
generally
demand
respect
for
parents
elders
and
certain
wise
or
brave
leaders
Hierarchical
power
structures
culminate
in
monotheism
where
a
supreme
all
wise
ever
present
but
undetectable
God
monitors
a
believers
every
thought
and
action
The
contrary
view
is
of
polytheism
where
many
gods
deny
supremacy
to
any
person
or
deity
Universal
democracy
is
a
form
of
this
since
every
elector
is
an
individual
but
the
average
of
their
collective
will
eventually
reign
supreme
Rather
than
respecting
the
personal
wishes
of
a
king
or
president
democrats
require
their
leaders
to
conform
to
their
collective
will
and
punish
those
who
abuse
their
delegated
power
Neither
absolute
personal
princely
power
nor
absolute
democracy
is
very
efficient
and
most
societies
strike
a
balance
The
United
States
of
America
and
the
Republic
of
France
have
powerful
presidents
but
their
term
of
office
is
very
short
Conversely
the
monarchs
of
the
Kingdoms
of
Spain
and
Britain
rule
for
life
but
they
have
very
little
power
or
freedom
although
their
experience
may
lend
them
a
certain
moral
authority
Religion
and
Law
The
European
Union
has
a
power
structure
so
complex
that
it
is
almost
beyond
understanding
and
relies
on
the
free
will
of
individual
nation
states
to
execute
its
directives
and
rewards
or
punishes
member
states
rather
than
their
individual
citizens
European
and
International
Law
emerged
mostly
from
the
Judeo
Christian
traditions
iluminated
by
some
notable
Muslim
interpretations
which
evolved
around
the
Iberian
peninsula
International
law
is
in
one
sense
a
form
of
religion
binding
in
other
religions
in
order
to
discourage
predatory
adventures
racism
and
genocide
whilst
equally
encouraging
communication
trade
and
individual
human
rights
guaranteed
by
the
state
in
which
people
reside
Not
all
states
subscribe
to
international
law
and
some
that
do
place
their
own
theocracy
or
judiciary
above
international
courts
The
USA
for
example
does
not
submit
itself
to
international
scrutiny
nor
require
nor
allow
its
citizens
to
submit
to
any
legal
code
except
its
own
constitution
Similarly
many
Muslim
countries
apply
Sharia
interpretive
contextual
judgments
rather
than
impose
the
rather
stark
international
codified
law
Christianity
The
Creation
in
Christianity
is
based
in
the
book
of
Genesis
Christians
believe
this
book
accurately
depicts
the
creation
Genesis
is
written
in
a
poetic
form
and
is
presumed
to
have
been
inspired
by
God
It
illustrates
the
creation
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Jewish
culture
and
its
people
There
is
an
argument
amongst
Christians
as
to
if
it
was
was
written
as
a
parable
evolution
via
intelligent
design
or
as
a
literal
truth
which
creationists
aver
Most
holy
scripture
is
both
historically
ancient
and
tends
to
be
in
a
mythological
language
style
Genesis
first
appeared
about
three
thousand
years
ago
in
the
tenth
century
Before
the
Common
Epoch
BC
probably
during
the
reign
af
King
Solomon
and
it
appears
to
have
been
written
re
written
translated
and
reinterpreted
by
many
authors
with
different
intentions
Genesis
is
not
a
scientific
document
since
the
scientific
method
was
invented
much
later
in
Baghdad
around
7th
to
10th
century
After
the
common
epoch
AC
Therefore
despite
the
claims
of
creationists
it
could
not
explain
the
creation
in
scientific
terms
Genesis
is
then
a
religious
document
that
explain
certain
spiritual
ideas
which
believers
accept
as
true
from
a
religious
and
spiritual
point
of
view
There
are
many
different
interpretations
about
the
Genesis
from
many
different
Christian
denominations
Historical
or
spiritual
truth
One
such
interpretation
would
state
that
although
the
book
of
Genesis
does
contain
poetry
and
other
types
of
literary
devices
it
is
primarily
a
historical
narrative
of
how
God
brought
about
the
beginning
of
the
universe
mankind
the
beginning
of
the
Chosen
nation
of
Israel
and
how
He
God
set
the
wheels
in
motion
for
the
beginning
of
his
grace
after
mankind
brought
about
the
beginning
of
sin
It
is
a
book
of
beginnings
as
is
reflected
in
the
title
of
the
book
Bereshith
In
the
beginning
Furthermore
for
believers
it
is
more
than
merely
a
religious
document
that
explains
spiritual
truths
from
a
religious
point
of
view
They
accept
Genesis
as
a
true
historical
narrative
that
reveals
the
reality
of
who
God
is
what
he
has
done
in
history
and
where
man
came
from
how
mankind
fell
into
sin
the
effects
of
the
fall
and
how
God
has
chosen
to
redeem
his
chosen
people
through
the
Jewish
people
and
his
covenant
and
ultimately
how
He
set
into
motion
the
redemption
of
the
elect
which
would
eventually
be
His
Church
Right
and
wrong
behaviors
just
rewards
and
punishments
are
exemplified
throughout
the
first
five
scriptural
books
Jewish
Torah
or
Christian
Pentateuch
of
which
Genesis
is
the
opening
salvo
Interpretation
There
are
several
points
of
differing
interpretations
within
Christian
Theology
about
the
actual
creation
narrative
itself
The
first
debate
begins
within
the
very
first
word
of
the
very
first
verse
Bereshith
The
problem
arises
in
the
interpretation
of
the
translation
Whereas
it
could
be
translated
In
a
beginning
using
an
indefinite
article
one
of
many
most
scholars
will
translate
it
as
In
the
Beginning
definite
article
and
therefore
the
unique
story
This
may
not
seem
like
a
big
issue
until
one
moves
to
the
second
verse
and
deals
with
the
translation
of
the
Hebrew
word
Hayathah
There
are
two
legitimate
translations
of
this
word
which
are
It
was
and
It
became
If
one
goes
with
the
former
translation
it
is
clear
that
this
is
interpreted
as
one
creation
that
simply
continues
the
narrative
of
verse
one
and
translates
Bereshith
as
In
the
Beginning
If
one
goes
with
the
latter
translation
then
this
would
open
the
possibility
for
many
different
creations
and
the
Gap
theory
and
would
continue
the
narrative
of
verse
one
which
translates
Bereshith
as
In
a
Beginning
While
the
Gap
Theorists
will
point
to
many
creation
stories
in
the
ancient
world
outside
of
the
Jewish
narrative
as
evidence
of
many
creations
proponents
of
one
creation
will
state
that
the
context
of
the
narrative
does
not
lend
itself
to
a
Gap
Theory
The
primary
context
of
the
narrative
is
not
to
tell
us
how
many
creations
there
were
but
rather
that
God
is
the
one
who
created
the
beginning
and
was
the
one
who
was
before
time
eternal
It
further
states
that
the
context
is
to
tell
us
about
the
beginning
of
man
sin
God
covenant
and
God
s
law
and
God
s
redemption
of
sinful
man
The
purpose
of
the
writers
of
Genesis
has
always
been
to
define
right
and
wrong
interactions
bestowing
blessings
and
sins
how
we
humans
may
justly
reward
and
punish
each
other
during
our
lives
and
how
post
mortem
we
will
ourselves
eventually
receive
divine
justice
calculated
and
delivered
fairly
and
utterly
by
a
unique
and
omnipotent
God
who
has
an
exact
record
of
our
every
passing
moment
History
or
Poetry
The
next
interpretive
issue
revolves
around
the
chronological
or
historical
timing
of
creation
There
are
scholars
who
firmly
believe
that
creation
must
have
occurred
no
longer
than
about
12
000
years
ago
This
date
may
be
approximately
deduced
from
the
genealogies
given
later
in
Genesis
and
on
a
literal
interpretation
of
a
seven
days
of
24
hours
cycle
of
creation
One
of
the
major
reasons
that
many
Christians
hold
to
this
interpretation
is
that
they
want
to
deflect
the
teachings
of
chance
or
Darwinian
evolution
If
creation
of
life
on
earth
was
simply
chance
then
the
fossil
records
and
carbon
dating
techniques
would
predate
Genesis
and
date
the
world
back
to
millions
of
years
God
would
then
become
merely
decorative
and
cultural
within
human
life
rather
than
truly
authoritative
and
believable
source
of
all
things
and
all
knowing
Contrary
to
Genesis
report
of
mankind
created
and
completed
in
an
instant
Darwin
would
allow
for
a
gradual
emergence
of
each
species
including
mankind
over
millions
of
years
Many
faithful
Christians
however
would
argue
that
the
timing
is
not
of
primary
importance
and
that
Genesis
explains
WHY
things
are
as
they
are
and
so
is
compatible
with
not
in
conflict
with
science
which
only
explains
how
things
may
have
become
as
they
are
The
actual
sequence
and
timing
being
immaterial
to
religious
purpose
Whether
mankind
emerged
within
a
seven
day
cycle
or
over
millions
of
years
the
primary
purpose
if
Genesis
is
to
confirm
that
God
is
eternal
and
is
the
one
agent
who
created
everything
One
argument
against
the
seven
24
hour
period
of
time
is
that
the
sun
and
the
moon
were
not
apparently
created
until
the
fourth
day
and
these
are
essential
elements
in
the
measurement
of
time
the
seasons
and
the
years
Another
argument
revolves
around
the
word
Yom
which
can
be
translated
either
as
a
day
or
used
to
indicate
some
undefined
period
of
time
A
third
argument
is
based
on
the
New
Testament
text
which
clarifies
time
as
it
is
understood
by
God
2
Peter
3
8
One
thing
is
certain
in
believers
minds
is
that
whether
mankind
emerged
gradually
over
millions
of
years
or
was
created
in
a
split
second
there
was
God
who
existed
before
time
as
we
humans
understand
it
and
it
was
God
who
created
all
things
in
accordance
with
divine
will

R
programming
style
R
is
an
object
oriented
programming
language
This
means
that
virtually
everything
can
be
stored
as
an
R
object
Each
object
has
a
class
This
class
describes
what
the
object
contains
and
what
each
function
does
with
it
For
instance
code
plot
x
code
produces
different
outputs
depending
on
whether
code
x
code
is
a
regression
object
or
a
vector
The
assignment
symbol
is
code
code
Alternatively
the
classical
code
code
symbol
can
be
used
The
two
following
statements
are
equivalent
source
lang
rsplus
a
2
a
2
source
Arguments
are
passed
to
functions
inside
round
brackets
parentheses
One
can
easily
combine
functions
For
instance
you
can
directly
type

This
is
also

Commands
are
normally
separated
by
a
newline
If
you
want
to
put
more
than
one
statement
on
a
line
you
can
use
the

source

You
can
also
have
one

R
is
case

code
a
code
and

A
code
are
two
different
objects
Traditionally
underscores
code
code
are
not
used
in

It
is
often
better
to
use

One
should
avoid
using
an

as
the
first
character
of
an

How
you

Mathematicians
usually
write
the
point
in

before
the
proof
and
label
it
either
Theorem
for
major
points
Corollary
for
points
that
follow
immediately
from
a
prior
one
or
Lemma
for
results
chiefly
used
to
prove
other
results
The
statements
expressing
propositions
can
be
complex
with
many
subparts
The
truth
or
falsity
of
the
entire
proposition
depends
both
on
the
truth
value
of
the
parts
and
on
the
words
used
to
assemble
the
statement
from
its
parts

For

where

P

is
a

it

An

if

then

are
both
true
statements
sometimes
said
to
be
vacuously
true
We
adopt
this
convention
because
we
want
statements
like
if
a
number
is
a
perfect
square
then
it
is
not
prime
to
be
true
for
instance
when
the
number
is

or
when
the
number
is

The
diagram

shows
that
math
Q
math
holds
whenever
math
P
math
does
another
phrasing
is
math
P
math
is
sufficient
to
give
math
Q
math
Notice
again
that
if
math
P
math
does
not
hold
math
Q
math
may
or
may
not
be
in
force
There
are
two
main
ways
to
establish
an
implication
The
first
way
is
direct
assume
that
math
P
math
is
true
and
using
that
assumption
prove
math
Q
math
For
instance
to
show
if
a
number
is
divisible
by
5
then
twice
that
number
is
divisible
by
10
assume
that
the
number
is
math
5n
math
and
deduce
that
math
2
5n
10n
math
anchor
contrapositive
The
second
way
is
indirect
prove
the
contrapositive
statement
if
math
Q
math
is
false
then
math
P
math
is
false
rephrased
math
Q
math
can
only
be
false
when
math
P
math
is
also
false
As
an
example
to
show
if
a
number
is
prime
then
it
is
not
a
perfect
square
argue
that
if
it
were
a
square
math
p
n
2
math
then
it
could
be
factored
math
p
n
cdot
n
math
where
math
n
p
math
and
so
wouldn
t
be
prime
of
course
math
p
0
math
or
math
p
1
math
don
t
give
math
n
p
math
but
they
are
nonprime
by
definition
Note
two
things
about
this
statement
form
First
an
if
math
P
math
then
math
Q
math
result
can
sometimes
be
improved
by
weakening
math
P
math
or
strengthening
math
Q
math
Thus
if
a
number
is
divisible
by
math
p
2
math
then
its
square
is
also
divisible
by
math
p
2
math
could
be
upgraded
either
by
relaxing
its
hypothesis
if
a
number
is
divisible
by
math
p
math
then
its
square
is
divisible
by
math
p
2
math
or
by
tightening
its
conclusion
if
a
number
is
divisible
by
math
p
2
math
then
its
square
is
divisible
by
math
p
4
math
Second
after
showing
if
math
P
math
then
math
Q
math
a
good
next
step
is
to
look
into
whether
there
are
cases
where
math
Q
math
holds
but
math
P
math
does
not
The
idea
is
to
better
understand
the
relationship
between
math
P
math
and
math
Q
math
with
an
eye
toward
strengthening
the
proposition
Equivalence
An
if
then
statement
cannot
be
improved
when
not
only
does
math
P
math
imply
math
Q
math
but
also
math
Q
math
implies
math
P
math
Some
ways
to
say
this
are
math
P
math
if
and
only
if
math
Q
math
math
P
math
iff
math
Q
math
math
P
math
and
math
Q
math
are
logically
equivalent
math
P
math
is
necessary
and
sufficient
to
give
math
Q
math
math
P
iff
Q
math
For
example
a
number
is
divisible
by
a
prime
if
and
only
if
that
number
squared
is
divisible
by
the
prime
squared
The
picture
here
shows
that
math
P
math
and
math
Q
math
hold
in
exactly
the
same
cases
center
Image
Linalg

Although
in
simple
arguments
a
chain
like
math
P
math
if
and
only
if
math
R
math
which
holds
if
and
only
if
math
S
math
may
be
practical
typically
we
show
equivalence
by
showing
the
if
math
P
math
then
math
Q
math
and
if
math
Q
math
then
math
P
math
halves

To
prove
that
a
statement
holds
in
all
cases
we
must
show
that
it
holds
in
each
case
Thus
to
prove
every
number
divisible
by

p
math
has
its
square
divisible
by
math
p

take
a
single

of

and
square
it
math
pn
2
p
2n

math
This
is
a
typical
element
or
generic
element
proof
This
kind
of
argument
requires
that
we
are
careful
to
not
assume
properties
for
that
element
other
than
those
in
the
hypothesis
mdash
for
instance
this
type
of
wrong
argument
is
a
common
mistake
if
math
n
math
is
divisible
by
a
prime
say
math
2
math
so
that
math
n
2k
math
then
math

2k
2
4k
2
math
and
the
square
of
the
number
is
divisible
by
the
square
of
the
prime
That
is
an
argument
about
the
case
math
p

math
but
it
isn

a
proof
for
general
math
p
math
There
exists
We
will
also
use
the
existential
quantifier
symbolized
math

math
and
read
there

As
noted
above
Venn
diagrams
are
not
much
help
with
quantifiers
but
a
picture
of

An
existence
proposition
can
be
proved
by
producing
something
satisfying
the
property
once
to
settle
the
question
of
primality
of
math

math
Euler

math
But
there
are
proofs
showing
that
something
exists
without
saying
how
to
find
it
Euclid
s
argument
given
in
the
next
subsection
shows
there
are
infinitely
many
primes
without
naming
them
In
general
while
demonstrating
existence
is
better
than
nothing
giving
an
example
is
better
and
an
exhaustive
list
of
all
instances
is
great
Still
mathematicians
take
what
they
can
get
Finally
along
with
Are
there
any
we
often
ask
How
many
That
is
why
the
issue
of
uniqueness
often
arises
in
conjunction
with
questions
of
existence
Many
times
the
two
arguments
are
simpler
if
separated
so
note
that
just
as
proving
something
exists
does
not
show
it
is
unique
neither
does
proving
something
is
unique
show
that
it
exists
Obviously
the
natural
number
with
more
factors
than
any
other
would
be
unique
but
in
fact
no
such
number
exists

Induction
Many
proofs
are
iterative
Here
s
why
the
statement
is
true
for
for
the
case
of
the
number
math
1
math
it
then
follows
for
math
2
math
and
from
there
to
math
3
math
and
so
on
These
are
called
proofs
by
induction
Such
a
proof
has
two
steps
anchor
base
step
In
the
base
step
the
proposition
is
established
for
some
first
number
often
math
0
math
or
math
1
math
anchor
inductive
step
Then
in
the
inductive
step
we
assume
that
the
proposition
holds
for
numbers
up
to
some
math
k
math
and
deduce
that
it
then
holds
for
the
next
number
math
k

math
Here
is
an
example
blockquote
We
will
prove
that

For
the
base
step
we
must
show
that
the
formula
holds
when
math

That
s
easy
the
sum
of
the
first
math
1
math
number
does
indeed
equal
math
1

2
math
For
the
inductive
step
assume
that
the
formula
holds
for
the
numbers
math
1
2
ldots
k
math
That
is
assume
all
of
these
instances
of
the
formula

From
this
assumption
we
will
deduce
that
the
formula
therefore
also
holds
in

case

is

We
ve
shown
in
the
base
case
that
the
above
proposition
holds
for
math
1
math
We
ve
shown
in
the
inductive
step
that
if
it
holds
for
the
case
of
math
1
math
then
it
also
holds
for
math
2
math
therefore
it
does
hold
for
math
2
math
We
ve
also
shown
in
the
inductive
step
that
if
the
statement
holds
for
the
cases
of
math
1
math
and
math
2
math
then
it
also
holds
for
the
next
case
math
3
math
etc
Thus
it
holds
for
any
natural
number
greater
than
or
equal
to
math
1
math
Here
is
another
example
blockquote
We
will
prove
that
every
integer
greater
than
math
1
math
is
a
product
of
primes
The
base
step
is
easy
math
2
math
is
the
product
of
a
single
prime
For
the
inductive
step
assume
that
each
of
math
2
3
ldots
k
math
is
a
product
of
primes
aiming
to
show
math
k
1
math
is
also
a
product
of
primes
There
are
two
possibilities
i
if
math
k
1
math
is
not
divisible
by
a
number
smaller
than
itself
then
it
is
a
prime
and
so
is
the
product
of
primes
and
ii
if
math
k
1
math
is
divisible
then
its
factors
can
be
written
as
a
product
of
primes
by
the
inductive
hypothesis
and
so
math
k
1
math
can
be
rewritten
as
a
product
of
primes
That
ends
the
proof
Remark
The
Prime
Factorization
Theorem
of
Number
Theory
says
that
not
only
does
a
factorization
exist
but
that
it
is
unique
We
ve
shown
the
easy
half
blockquote
There
are
two
things
to
note
about
the
next
number
in
an
induction
argument
For
one
thing
while
induction
works
on
the
integers
it
s
no
good
on
the
reals
There
is
no
next
real
The
other
thing
is
that
we
sometimes
use
induction
to
go
down
say
from
math
10
math
to
math
9
math
to
math
8
math
etc
down
to
math
0
math
So
next
number
could
mean
next
lowest
number
Of
course
at
the
end
we
have
not
shown
the
fact
for
all
natural
numbers
only
for
those
less
than
or
equal
to
math
10
math
Contradiction
Another
technique
of
proof
is
to
show
something
is
true
by
showing
it
can
t
be
false
blockquote
The
classic
example
is
Euclid
s
that
there
are
infinitely
many
primes
Suppose
there
are
only
finitely
many
primes
math
p
1
dots
p
k
math
Consider
math
p
1
cdot
p
2

p
k
1
math
None
of
the
primes
on
this
supposedly
exhaustive
list
divides
that
number
evenly
each
leaves
a
remainder
of
math
1
math
But
every
number
is
a
product
of
primes
so
this
can
t
be
Thus
there
cannot
be
only
finitely
many
primes
blockquote
Every
proof
by
contradiction
has
the
same
form
assume
that
the
false
proposition
is
true
and
derive
some
contradiction
to
known
facts
This
kind
of
logic
is
known
as
Aristotelian
Logic
or
Term
Logic
blockquote
Another
example
is
this
proof
that
math
sqrt
2
math
is
not
a
rational
number
Suppose
that
math
sqrt
2
m
n

math

The
Prime
Factorization
Theorem
says
that
there
must
be
the
same
number
of
factors
of
math
2
math
on
both
sides
but
there
are
an
odd
number
math
1
2k
n
math
on
the
left
and
an
even
number
math
2k
m
math
on
the
right
That
s
a
contradiction
so
a
rational
with
a
square
of
math
2
math
cannot
be
blockquote
Both
of
these
examples
aimed
to
prove
something
doesn
t
exist
A
negative
proposition
often
suggests
a
proof
by
contradiction

even
constructs

that
involve
piecing

The

math
is
the

sending
math

It
is
denoted
math

makes

if

the

an

Of

a

A

f
math
is
called
simply
an

An

middle
equality
comes
from
the

we
often
call
it
the

For
instance
the

The

f

notation
for
function

can
be
confusing
mdash
it
doesn
t
mean
math
1
f
x
math
It
is
used
because
it
fits
into
a
larger
scheme
Functions
that
have
the
same
codomain
as
domain
can
be
iterated
so
that
where
math
f

math
we
can
consider
the
composition
of
math
f
math
with
itself
math
f
circ
f
math
and
math
f
circ
f
circ

etc
Naturally
enough
we
write
math
f
circ
f
math
as
math
f
2
math
and
math
f
circ
f
circ
f
math
as
math
f

Note
that
the
familiar

hold

The
relationship
with
the
prior
paragraph
is
that
where
math
f
math
is
invertible
writing
math
f

math
for
the
inverse
and
math
f
2
math
for
the
inverse
of
math
f

math
etc
gives
that
these
familiar
exponent
rules
continue
to
hold
once
math
f

math
is
defined
to
be
the
identity
map
anchor

If
the
codomain
math
Y
math
equals
the
range
of
math
f
math
then
we
say
that
the
function
is
onto
or
surjective
A
function
has
a
right
inverse
if
and
only
if
it
is
onto
this
is
not
hard
to
check
anchor
injective
If
no
two
arguments
share
an
image
if
math
x
1
neq
x
2
math
implies
that
math
f
x
1
neq
f
x
2
math
then
the
function
is
one
to
one
or
injective
A
function
has
a
left
inverse
if
and
only
if
it
is
one
to

this
is
also
not
hard
to
check
anchor
bijection
By
the
prior
paragraph
a
map
has
an
inverse
if
and
only
if
it
is
both
onto
and
one
to
one
such
a
function
is
a
correspondence
It
associates
one
and
only
one
element
of
the
domain
with
each
element
of
the
range
for
example
finite
sets
must
have
the
same
number
of
elements
to
be
matched
up
in
this
way
Because
a
composition
of
one
to
one
maps
is
one
to
one
and
a
composition
of
onto
maps
is
onto
a
composition
of
correspondences
is
a
correspondence
We
sometimes
want
to
shrink
the
domain
of
a
function
For
instance
we
may
take
the
function
math
f
mathbb
R
to
mathbb
R
math
given
by
math
f
x
x
2
math
and
in
order
to
have
an
inverse
limit
input
arguments
to
nonnegative
reals
math
hat
f
mathbb
R

R
math

Technically
math
hat
f
math
is
a
different
function
than
math
f
math
we
call
it
the
restriction
of
math
f
math
to
the
smaller
domain
A
final
point
on
functions
neither
math
x
math
nor
math
f
x
math
need
be
a
number
As
an
example
we
can
think
of
math
f
x
y
x
y
math
as
a
function
that
takes
the
ordered

x

as
its

Some
familiar
operations
are
obviously

But
what
of
math
math
or
math
math
We
here
take
the
approach
of
rephrasing
math
3

math
to
math

math
is
in
the
relation
math
math

binary
That
is
define
a
binary
relation
on
a
set
math
A
math
to
be
a
set
of
ordered
pairs
of
elements
of

A
math
For
example
the
math
math

is
the

some
elements
of
that
set
are

math

math
and

Another
binary
relation
on
the
natural
numbers
is
equality
this
relation
is
formally
written
as
the
set
math
ldots

Still
another

Some

Those

Equivalence

We
shall
need
to
say
formally
that
two
objects
are
alike
in
some
way
While
these

things
aren

identical
they
are

give

there

So
integers
fall
into
exactly
one
of
two
classes

A

Picture

Thus
the
first
paragraph
says

partitions
the
integers

and
the

Similarly
the
equivalence
relation
partitions
the

into

Another
example
is
the
fractions
Of
course

is
for

S

Before
we
show
that
equivalence

always
give
rise
to

we
first
illustrate

We

two
pieces
the

the

and
inside
a

each

has
the

So
for

Proof
Call
the
set
math
S
math
and
the
relation
math
R
math
In
line
with
the
illustration
in
the
paragraph
above
for
each
math
x
in
S
math
define
math
S
x
y
big
x
y
in
R
math
Observe
that
as
math
x
math
is
a
member
if
math
S
x
math
the
union
of
all
these
sets
is
math
S
math
So
we
will
be
done
if
we
show
that
distinct
parts
are
disjoint
if
math
S
x
neq
S
y
math
then
math
S
x
cap
S
y
varnothing
math
We
will
verify
this
through
the
contrapositive
that
is
we
wlll
assume
that
math
S
x
cap
S
y
neq
varnothing
math
in
order
to
deduce
that
math
S
x
S
y
math
Let
math
p
math
be
an
element
of
the
intersection
Then
by
definition
of
math
S
x
math
and
math
S
y
math
the
two
math
x
p
math
and
math
y
p
math
are
members
of
math
R
math
and
by
symmetry
of
this
relation
math
p
x
math
and
math
p
y
math
are
also
members
of
math
R
math
To
show
that
math
S
x
S
y
math
we
will
show
each
is
a
subset
of
the
other
Assume
that
math
q
in
S
x
math
so
that
math
q
x
in
R
math
Use
transitivity
along
with
math
x
p
in
R
math
to
conclude
that
math
q
p
math
is
also
an
element
of
math
R
math
But
math
p
y
in
R
math
so
another
use
of
transitivity
gives
that
math
q
y
in
R
math
Thus
math
q
in
S
y
math
Therefore
math
q
in
S
x
math
implies
math
q
in
S
y
math
and
so
math
S
x
subseteq
S
y
math
The
same
argument
in
the
other
direction
gives
the
other
inclusion
and
so
the
two
sets
are
equal
completing
the
contrapositive
argument
anchor

classes
We
call
each
part
of
a

an

We

a

of

to

The
proteins
are
anatomically
classified
into
integral
and
peripheral
proteins
Difference
between
integral
peripheral
proteins
Integral
proteins
penetrate
the
membrane
and
peripheral
proteins
are
just
attached
to
one
side
Integral
proteins
can
act
as
channels
or
pores
and
others
act
as
carriers
and
transporters
of
various
substances
Peripheral
proteins
serve
a
number
of
functions
and
in
many
cases
serve
to
activate
the
integral
proteins
Some
of
the
proteins
are
enzymes
others
serve
as
second
messengers
This
will
be
looked
at
in
some
detail
in
the
chapter
on
membrane
dynamics
Cholesterol
is
found
in
varying
amounts
in
the
membrane
It
tends
to
be
found
between
the
triglyceride
stalks
of
the
phospholipids
and
serves
to
make
the
membrane
less
porous
Most
proteins
and
many
lipids
are
glycoprotins
or
glycolipids
and
the
ve
carbohydrate
end
of
the
molecule
is
presented
to
the
extracellular
fluid
This
carbohydrate
layer
is
sreferred
to
as
the
Glycocalyx
of
the
cell
These
carbohydrates
serve
several
important
functions
Many
have
a
negative
electrical
charge
which
repels
other
negatively
charged
ions
They
serve
to
attach
cells
to
one
another
and
to
the
basement
membrane
Many
act
as
receptor
sites
for
hormones
such
as
Insulin
They
enter
into
immune
reactions
Cell
Membrane
Proteins
Cell
membrane
proteins
may
be
functionally
classified
into
four
groups
Structural
Proteins
On
the
interior
of
the
cell
these
serve
as
anchors
for
the
actin
and
tubulin
microfibrils
see
below
On
the
exterior
they
serve
to
bind
cells
together
into
tissues
see
Cell
Junctions
and
Tissues
Enzymes
In
the
small
intestine
many
of
the
digestive
enzymes
are
embedded
in
the
cell
wall
see
Digestion
Receptors
These
act
as
receptors
for
the
messenger
system
of
the
cell
For
example
Insulin
exerts
its
effects
on
the
cell
by
binding
onto
a
special
receptor
see
Membrane
Dynamics
Transporters
these
serve
to
transport
molecules
in
and
out
of
the
cell
They
may
be
either
channels
or
carriers
This
is
discussed
further
in
Membrane
Dynamics
Cell
Cytoplasm
The
cytoplasm
is
filled
with
dispersed
particles
and
organules
The
liquid
portion
of
the
cytoplasm
is
called
cytosol
and
contains
dissolved
ions
proteins
and
glucose
Also
found
are
neutral
fat
globules
and
glycogen
It
also
contains
the
important
organules
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
ribosomes
golgi
apparatus
lysosomes
proxiosomes
and
secretory
granules
Ribosomes
These
are
the
sites
of
the
manufacture
of
proteins
from
a
mRNA
template
They
are
complex
structures
made
up
of
ribosomal
RNA
and
proteins
The
are
composed
of
a
large
and
a
small
subunit
which
clamp
onto
the
messanger
RNA
that
they
translate
Most
ribosomes
can
be
found
lining
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
but
the
cytoplasm
also
contains
many
free
ribosomes
This
will
be
discussed
in
further
detail
under
the
Protein
Manufacture
section
Endoplasmic
reticulum
This
membranous
sac
is
a
complex
series
of
tubules
continuous
with
the
nuclear
membrane
It
is
sub
classified
as
a
rough
or
granular
ER
and
a
smooth
or
agranular
ER
The
rough
Endoplasmic
reticulum
is
lined
with
ribosomes
and
modifies
and
packages
proteins
that
have
been
produced
by
the
ribosome
In
skeletal
and
cardiac
muscle
it
is
known
as
the
sarcoplasmic
reticulum
The
smooth
ER
synthesize
fatty
substances
and
is
the
site
of
detoxification
processes
Golgi
apparatus
The
Golgi
apparatus
is
a
series
of
stacked
membrane
enclosed
sacs
usually
six
or
more
It
is
a
polarized
structure
with
a
cis
and
a
trans
side
The
cis
side
faces
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
the
trans
side
the
cell
membrane
Its
job
is
to
process
and
package
substances
both
protein
and
non
protein
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
The
Golgi
apparatus
modifies
the
oligo
saccharide
attachments
of
the
glyco
proteins
that
have
been
initially
prepared
in
the
ER
Membranous

off
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
are
transported
across
to
the
cis
Golgi
apparatus
Substances
are
exchanged
between
one
layer
of
the
Golgi
apparatus
and
another
by
a
similar
process
The
vesicles
that
pinch
off
from
the
trans
side
shuttle
to
lyosomes
or
to
the
cell
exterior
Those
destined
for
the
cell
exterior
are
follow
either
consitutive
or
non
constitutive
also
known
as
regulated
pathways
Those
following
consitutive
pathways
are
immediately
secreted
those
following
a
non
constitutive
pathway
either
form
an
excretory
vesicle
or
are
shunted
to
an
existing
vesicle
where
further
processing
may
be
carried
out
File
Golgi

The
destination
of
Golgi
vesicles
indeed
the
destination
of
all
vesicles
is
under
the
control
of
special
proteins
attached
to
the
vesicle
called
SNARES
for
S
oluble
N
ethylmalemite
sensitive

A

RE
ceptors
These
SNARES
are
either
v
SNARES
for
vesicle
or
t
SNARES
for
target
and
they
interact
in
a
lock
and
key
fashion
35
different
SNARE
proteins
have
been
identified
in
humans
The
process
involved
in
protein
synthesis
is
extremely
complex
with
plenty
of
places
where
errors
can
creep
in
The
quality
control
process
starts
with
the
DNA
where
damaged
DNA
is
either
repaired
or
bypassed
the
mRNAs
are
checked
during
the
translation
process
and
the
ER
and
GA
are
particularly
important
in
quality
control
weeding
out
substandard
or
damaged
proteins
Lyosomes
Lyosomes
are
large
somewhat
irregular
membrane
surrounded
structures
found
in
the
cytoplasm
The
contents
of
the
Lyosome
are
acidic
in
nature
and
contain
numerous
enzymes
for
breaking
down
substrates
The
act
as
the
digestive
system
of
the
cell
The
following
enzymes
are
present
in
most
lyosomes

Clinical
Note
If
an
enzyme
is
congenitally
absent
then
the
lyosome
will
become
engorged
on
the
substrate
particular
to
the
missing
enzyme
These
result
in
the
rare
Lyosomal
Storage
Diseases
An
example
of
a
Lyosomal
Storage
Disease
is
Tay
Sachs
In
Tay
Sachs
disease
an
enzyme
that
breaks
down
gangliosides
a
lipoprotein
found
in
neural
tissue
is
missing
and
gangliosides
accumulate
in
the
cells
of
the
brain
resulting
in
mental
retardation
and
blindness
About
1

30
American
Jews
carry
the
gene
for
Tay
Sachs
Peroxiosomes
Peroxiosomes
are
membrane
surrounded
vesicles
with
a
matrix
that
contains
numerous
enzymes
which
catalyse
a
variety
of
anabolic
and
catabolic
reactions
The
membrane
of
the
peroxiosome
have
numerous
protein
carriers
that
are
concerned
with
transport
of
substrates
in
and
out
of
the
matrix
of
the
peroxiosome
Secretory
Vesicles
The
Golgi
apparatus
will
also
package
enzymes
or
hormones
for
later
release
These
are
stored
in
the
cell
as
secretory
vesicles
awaiting
a
suitable
trigger
for
release
These
comprise
a
non
constitutive
secretion
and
in
many
cases
the
Golgi
apparatus
provides
the
vesicle
with
a
pro
hormone
or
pro
enzyme
that
is
further
processed
in
the
secretory
vesicle

Cells
contain
an
extensive

microfilaments
which
act

both
a
cyto
skeleton
and
a
means
for

Mitochondria
sing
mitochondrion
are
known
as
the
powerhouses
of
the
cell
producing
the
majority
about
95
of
the
ATP
that
is
used
in
cell
metabolism
We
will
look
at
this
in
greater
detail
in
the
section
on
ATP
and
Oxidative
Phosphorylation
Mitochondria
come
in
various
shapes
and
sizes
from
round
or
spheroid
to
sausage
or
obloid
in
shape
The
more
active
a
cell
is
the
more
mitochondria
they
have
They
have
a
double
bilayer
membrane
an
outer
and
in
inner
membrane
The
inner
membrane
is
is
folded
into
cristae
and
the
walls
of
these
cristae
are
studded
with
enzyme
rich
proteins
which
are
involved
in
the
production
of
ATP
Between
the
two
membranes
is
the
gel
of
the
outer
matrix
rich
in
enzymes
for
the
processing
of
high
energy
hydrogen
to
ATP
In
the
inner
space
is
the
inner
matrix
which
contains
numerous
enzymes
involved
in
the
breakdown
of
Glucose
fats
and
proteins
for
energy
Mitochondria
have
several
anomolies
They
are
self
replicating
and
in
fact
have
their
own
unique
DNA
When
a
mitochondria
replicates
a
new
one
buds
off
from
an
old
one
similar
in
fashion
to
the
way
a
bacteria
replicates
This
process
is
under
the
control
of
the
mitochondria
s
own
DNA
Most
of
the
proteins
and
enzymes
of
mitochondria
over
98
are
in
fact
manufactured
by
the
cells
DNA
but
many
of
the
enzymes
and
proteins
involved
in
oxidation
and
phosphorylation
are
manufactured
by
the
mitochondria
s
DNA
The
mitochondrial
DNA
is
not
stored
in
a
nucleus
but
is
in
the
form
of
a
double
circular
molecule
containing
16
569
base
pairs
compared
with
over
a
billion
base
pairs
in
the
cells
nucleus
This
is
similar
to
the
way
DNA
is
stored
in
bacteria
There
are
other
features
similar
to
bacteria
which
has
led
to
the
postulation
that
mitochondria
evolved
from
an
aerobic
bacterium
that
got
ingested
by
a
eukaryotic
cell
and
then
learned
to
live
in
symbiosis
with
it

Sperm
contain
four
mitochondria
which
are
carried
with
the
sperms
tail
These
are
shed
when
the
sperms
head
fuses
with
the
ovum
This
means
that
all
mitochondrial
DNA
is
descended
from
the
female
line
Mitochondrial
DNA
also
has
few
of
the
reparative
mechanisms
of
eukaryotic
DNA
which
means
that
the
mutation
rate
is
much
faster
than
inn

This
has
allowed
paleo

to
trace
the
ancestry
of
humans
and
show
that
we
had
a

female
ancestor
about
60
million
years
ago
In
passing
it
should
be
noted
that
a

The
Quicksort
alogrithm
s
intent
can
be
elegantly
expressed
in
Haskell
with
the
help
of
list
comprehensions
br
code
qsort
qsort
x
xs
qsort
y
y
xs
y
x
x
qsort
y

x
code
Note
that
because
of
excessive
copying
and
concatenation
of
lists
this
code
can
be
rather
slow
depending
on
the
implementation
But
more
importantly
the
above
code
is
not
in
place
which
is
an
essential
characteristic
of
genuine
quicksort
Haskell
s
data
is
immutable
though
but
at
least
the
list
s
double
traversal
can
be
eliminated
with
code
qsort
qsort
x
xs
let
a
b
part
xs

qsort

qsort

where

Just
hazily
wondering
but
is
it
really
worth
it
to
optimize
the
sample
implementations
in
this
Overview
page
at
the
cost
of
clarity
and
elegance
given
that
its
main
point
is
demonstrating
to
the
readers
in
a
clear
way
what
the

looks

Don
t
know
That
s
why
I
put
it
here
hoping
for
someone
wiser
than
me
to
make
a
judgment
It
s
just
that
I
ve
seen
the
list
comprehension
variant
above
mentioned
as
an
example
of
how
Haskell
makes
it
very
easy
to
write
terribly
inefficient
code
I
was
also
hoping
that
the
simplified
code
I
ve
put
on
the
page
itself
be
sufficiently
clear
and
easy
for
a
beginner
to
read
The
original
code
makes
double
traverse
of
the
list
structure
for
no
other
reason
than
to
be
visually
appealing
Maybe
that
s
exactly
a
kind
of
example
that
beginners
ought
not
to
see
at
all
Would
appreciate
any
feedback

Variables
Very
often
you
have
to
convert
variable
from
a
string
to
a
numerical
format
There
are
several
way
to
do
it
If
you
already
have
numeric
values
in
your
string
variable
you
should
use
destring
Otherwise
you
should
use
the
encode
command
Encode
will
automatically
create
a
numerical
variable
and
will
use
as
a
value
label
the
string

of
the
previous
variable

Expand
You
can
expand
a

ie
multiplying
observations
by
a
given
factor
using
the
expand
command
This
is
useful
for
generating
panel
data
models

we

Shell
programs
calling
Stata
For
ongoing
projects
one
may
want
to
embed
Stata
scripts
into
an
automated
workflow
This
section
will
show
you
how
to
run
Stata
do
files
from
the
command
line
For
these
examples
you
will
have
to
include
the
folder
of
your
Stata
executable
into
your
PATH
environment
variable
Depending
on
your
flavor
of
Stata
SE
MP
IC
Small
your
Stata
executable
may
also
have
a
slightly
different
name
If
you
just
call
Stata
with
the
do
file
as
its
only
argument
such
as
StataSE
myscript
do
Then
Stata
will
open
in
normal
interactive
mode
and
do
one
of
two
things
depending
on
your
user
preferences
It
may
execute
the
script
running
do
myscript
do
or
open
the
do
file
editor
doedit
myscript
do
To
set
this
preference
open
the
do
file
editor
and
then
go
to
Edit
Preferences
and
set
the
option
for
Edit
do
files
opened
from
Windows
instead
of
executing
them
Alternatively
you
can
call
Stata
in
background
batch
mode
such
as
StataSE
e
do
myscript
do
This
will
execute
your
script
keep
the
Stata
window
minimized
and
automatically
log
everything
to
myscript
log
in
the
current
working
directory
there
is
no
way
to
turn
off
this
automatic
logging
in
batch
mode
Calling
shell
commands
shell
winexec
in
batch
mode
will
not
work
from
Window

and
parallel
By
default
Stata
will
inherit
the
working
directory
from
the
Shell
For
example
cd
myproject
Stata
e
do
code
myscript
do
Stata
will
run
with
the
working
directory
as
myproject
The
log
file
will
be
there
as
well
so
this
is
a
way
to
have
your
log
files
end
up
in
a
different
directory
than
you
do
files

Performing
multiple
regression
on
the
same
subsample
Sometimes
you
want
to
perform
multiple
regressions
on
the
same
subsample
This
is
not
obvious
since
when
one
of
the
variable
of
the
model
is
missing
the
observation
is
dropped
One
way
to
be
sure
that
you
use
the
same
subsample
is
to
use
the
e
sample
command
which
returns
the
list
of
all
used
observations
In
the
example
below
qui
store
the
result
of
e
sample
in
variables
samp1
and
samp2
and
we
perform
the
model
conditionning
on
samp1
1
samp2

Thus
we
are
sure
that
both
estimation
are
done

My

here
My
edits
here
will
mainly
be
due
to
removal
of
unwanted
external
links
and
vandalism
Generally
the
edits
I
revert
have
been
performed
on
a
large
number
of
wikimedia
projects
or
the
info
I
remove
has
been
added
pushed
to
a
large
number
of
wikimedia
projects
hence
regarding
edits
that
were
very
similar
in
nature
and
is
considered
generaly
unhelpful
If
the
removal
concerns
external
links
then
the
removal
may
very
well
precede
or
follow
meta
blacklisting
and
the
removal
is
to
prevent
further
disruption
I
will
be
able
to
provide
evidence
of
the
wide
scale
disruption
that
has
been
performed
by
the
editor
whose
edits
I
revert
Please
note
that
the
info
on
a
singular
wiki
may
seem
appropriate
but
the
user
I
am
handling
is
probably
performing
their
edits
on
a
large
number
of
wikis
If
you
feel
the
edit
is
here
appropriate
or
even
wanted
just
revert

When
I
saw
that
you
had
changed
the
wording
of
requirement
4a
I
went
back
and
checked
the
official
NAD
requirements
which
matched
the
requirement
as
it
was
before
your
change
Then
I
checked
the
GC
s
version
and
saw
that
your
change
adopts
their
version
OK
These
are
close
enough
to
being
the
same
that
I
am
not
inclined
to
fork
the
honor
into
a
GC
vs
NAD
version
which
is
my
usual
approach
for
showing
multiple
versions

Unlike
Irish
Manx
Gaelic
uses
the
traditional
English
alphabet
with
the
exception
of
the
letters
x
and
z
Hmm
I
spy
a
couple
of
problems
with
that
sentence
Firstly
Manx
uses
the
same
alphabet
as
Irish
AND
English
the
Latin
or
Roman
alphabet
If
it
is
orthography
that
this
sentence
is
implying
then
Manx
shares
some
features
with
both
Welsh
and
English
but
that
is
nothing
to
do
with
alphabet
and
everything
to
do
with
orthography
Manx
also
uses
the
letters
and
albeit
the
latter
two
in
older
examples
neither
of
which
are
available
in
ANY
British
Isles
language
This
sentence
needs
to
be
rewritten

Whorled
Loosestrife
is
a
weedy
plant
that
most
people
would
pull
up
without
giving
a
second
thought
But
if
you
see
this
plant
in
bloom
take
a
close
look
at
the
flowers
They
have
five
yellow
pointed
petals
making
the
flower
look
like
a
star
At
the
center
of
the
flower
is
a
tube
called
a
style
It
is
surrounded
by
red
triangles
one
per
petal
Each
flower
grows
at
the
end
of
a
little
stem
called
a
petiole
peh
tee
ole
which
attaches
to
the
main
stem
Lots
of
things
attach
to
the
main
stem
at
this
point
not
only
four
sometimes
five
flowers
but
usually
four
sometimes
five
leaves
as
well
It
almost
looks
like
the
flowers
are
there
to
light
up
the
plant
s
surroundings
as
if
they
were
the
light
fixtures
in
a
parking
lot
or
at
a
ball
field
facts
The
genus
name
of
Whorled
Loosestrife
is
Lysimachia
lie
sih
mock
ee
yuh
It
is
named
after
Lysimachus
one
of
Alexander
the
Great
s
generals
He
was
said
to
have
fed
a
member
of
the
genus
to
a
bull
to
calm
it
down
The
colonists
must
have
heard
this
legend
because
they
used
to
feed
this
plant
to
their
oxen
to
make
them
work
together
peacefully

Birdsfoot
Trefoil
is
a
clover
like
plant
with
oddly
shaped
yellow
flowers
The
plant
doesn
t
get
more
than
a
couple
of
feet
high
and
usually
is
a
high
as
the
other
plants
it
grows
among
It
was
brought
to
North
America
as
a
pasture
crop
because
it
can
be
grazed
close
to
the
ground
and
still
survive
The
leaves
usually
appear
in
fives
even
though
the
name
suggests
that
there
would
only
be
three
Trefoil
means
three
leaves
It
was
so
named
because
three
of
the
five
leaves
are
held
higher
than
the
other
two
facts
The
Birdsfoot
part
of
the
name
comes
from
the
shape
of
the
seed
stalk

Common
Mullein
is
a
tall
plant
that
lives
for
two
years
During
the
first
year
it
forms
a
bunch
of
leaves
forming
a
circle
around
the
plant
s
root
In
the
second
year
it
sends
up
a
tall
stem
sometimes
over
six
feet
tall
The
stem
is
covered
with
flowers
but
only
a
few
of
them
are
in
bloom
at
a
time
The
flowers
are
yellow
with
five
rounded
petals
The
leaves
are
covered
with
a
very
soft
velvety
hair
which
leads
to
one
of
its
many
nicknames
lamb
s
ear
If
you
find
one
of
these
plants
do
take
the
time
to
feel
the
soft
leaves
facts
Common
Mullein
has
many
medical
uses
and
has
been
found
to
be
particularly
effective
for
easing
coughs
It
can
also
be
used
to
make
a
dye
and
the
stems
have
been
used
as
torches

Several
Daylilies
in
a
garden
description
The
Daylily
produces
huge
yellow
or
orange
flowers
depending
on
the
variety
Each
flower
looks
like
it
has
six
petals
but
really
it
only
has
three
true
petals
The
other
three
are
called
tepals
tee
pulls
The
leaves
are
long
and
slender
Daylilies
belong
to
a
large
category
of
plant
called
monocots
Mah
no
kots
Monocots
often
have
long
slender
leaves
and
the
veins
in
these
leaves
will
always
run
in
the
same
direction
and
do
not
branch
The
flowers
of
most
monocots
almost
always
have
either
three
or
six
petals
If
a
plant
is
not
a
monocot
it
s
a
dicot
die
cot
So
even
if
you
can
t
tell
anything
else
about
a
plant
you
should
be
able
to
tell
if
it
s
a
monocot
or
a
dicot
by
looking
at
the
leaf
veins
and
counting
the
petals
facts
The
Daylily
is
an
edible
plant
The
Chinese
use
the
flowers
as
an
ingredient
in
hot

Butter
and
Eggs
is
a
beautiful
yellow
and
orange
flower
The
orange
part
looks
like
the
yolk
of
an
egg
and
the
yellow
part
is
about
the
same
color
as
butter
These
flowers
have
an
odd
shape
The
orange
lip
is
closed
so
the
flower
can
only
be
pollinated
by
strong
insects
such
as
honey
bees
or
bumble
bees
Butter
and
Eggs
grows
between
one
and
three
feet
high
and
has
long
narrow
leaves
facts
While
most
commonly
found
as
a
weed
Butter
and
Eggs
is
sometimes
grown
for
flower
shops
The
flowers
last
a
long
time
in
a
vase
Like
snapdragons
they
are
often
grown
in
children
s
gardens
for
the
snapping
flowers
which
can
be
made
to
talk
by

them

Joins
The
Most
important
aspect
of
SQL
is
its
relational
features
You
can
query
compare
and
calculate
two
different
tables
having
entirely
different
structure
Joins
and
subselects
are
the
two
methods
to
join
tables
Both
methods
of
joining
tables
should
give
the
same
results
The
natural
join
is
faster
on
most
SQL
platforms

The
reason
for
the
update
of
the
OLD
version
is
because
there
was
a
lot
of
unnecessary
information
Following
information
is
not
wanted
no
extra
knowledge
about
how
to
design
a
system
technical
information
repeating
something
available
on
wikiPEDIA
excessive
summation
of
examples
Also
the
structure
wasn
t
up
to
date
The
new
structure
uses
the
5
phases
as
given
in
the
chapter
Design

Also
added
information
of
the
system
complexity
and

SUGGESTION
The

Introduction
Modern
technology
is
giving
us
unprecedented
understanding
of
and
access
to
processes
on
size
scales
ranging
from
that
of
humans
to
that
of
atoms
As
a
result
thoughts
about
changing
perspective
are
increasingly
both
fun
and
of
potentially
practical
value
Put
another
way
now
it
is
not
only
fun
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
take
a
shrinking
pill
like
Alice
in
Wonderland
The
prospect
of
building
a
12
globe
with
a
3D
model
of
every
house
visible
on
Google
Earth
is
moving
into
technological
range
as
is
the
possibility
of
finding
robotic
or
perhaps
even
biological
inhabitants
that
might
be
inclined
to
take
advantage
of
such
emerging
real
estate
Examples
Models
The
meter
hArr
millimeter
model
This
takes
objects
which
are
a
meter
in
size
down
to
a
millimeter
Hence
size
is
divided
by
a
factor
of
1000
Imagine
for
example
that
your
living
room
floor
were
covered
by
a
1
1000
model
of
a
present
day
city
What
would
that
city
look
like
to
you
If
ordinary
humans
can
resolve
a
tenth
of
a
millimeter
with
one
s
naked
eye
they
might
only
be
able
to
resolve
a
tenth
of
a
milli
world
meter
i
e
objects
that
are
about
four
milli
world
inches
across
That
means
that
you
might
be
able
to
see
a
milli
human
s
hand
but
you
probably
couldn
t
see
what
they
were
doing
with
their
fingers

Kinetic
energy
vs
reciprocal
wavelength
As
you
can
see
from
the
table
above
visible
light
s
wavelength
gets
a
bit
large
as
size
scales
move
below
a
micron
As
object
sizes
shrink
to
that
of
the
illumination
s
wavelength
ray
optics
goes
out
the
window
and
only
interference
effects
remain
to
give
us
clues
about
what
s
there
The
figure
at
right
shows
how
the
wavelength
of
anything
Planck
s
constant
divided
by
momentum
relates
to
that
thing
s
kinetic
energy
If
we
want
small
wavelengths
therefore
we
either
have
to
illuminate
with
high
energy
photons
like
X
rays
and
gamma
rays
which
are
difficult
to
focus
and
detect
or
to
illuminate
with
charged
particles
Charge
makes
particles
easy
to
focus
and
detect
with
help
from
electric
fields
The
particle
with
the
highest
charge
to
mass
ratio
may
turn
out
to
be
the
electron
shown
by
the
red
line
in
the
figure
at
right
Electrons
thus
interact
most
strongly
with
matter
On
the
other
hand
higher
mass
particles
have
shorter
wavelengths
for
a
given
amount
of
kinetic
energy
Hence
they
too
come
in
handy
as
probes
of
the
very
small
Development

The
real
world
We
refer
here
to
the
challenge
of
building
small
agents
e
g
nano
robots
equipped
with
the
following
a
central
processing
unit
CPU
some
sort
of
eyes
and
or
other
local
sensors
some
on
board
memory
an
ability
to
move
from
point
to
point
a
capacity
for
two
way
communication
with
humans
in
the
larger
world
a
source
of
ordered
energy
and
a
way
to
eliminate
waste
heat
What
are
our
prospects
for
building
and
integrating
each
of
these
components
on
smaller
and
smaller
size
scales
communications
memory
logic
processors
sensors
Imaging
sensors
will
be
limited
by
the
wavelength
of
the
excitations
used
For
example
the
wavelength
of
light
may
be
a
problem
for
cameras
and
image
resolutions
much
smaller
than
the
visible
wavelength
range
of
400
700
nanometers
mobility
power
considerations
Do
we
carry
our
fuel
with
us
or
plan
on
finding
it
on
the
road
Also
how
do
we
dump
excess
heat
I
have
a
feeling
that
many
biological
systems
have
already
figured
this
stuff

We

K
Ordered
Logit
multinomial
ordered
logit
model
with
unkwnown
thresholds
First
we
simulate
fake
data
We
draw
the
residuals
in
a
logistic
distribution
Then
we
draw
some
explanatory
variable
x
and
we
define
ys
the
latent
variable
as
a
linear
function
of
x
Note
that
we
set
the
constant
to
0
because
the
constant
and
the
thresholds
cannot
be
identified
simultanously
in
this
model
So
we
need
to
fix
one
of
the
parameters
Then
we
define
thresholds
1
0
1
and
we
define
our
observed
variable
y
using
the
code
cut
code
function
So
y
is

R
provides
functions
to
deal
with
various
set
of
encoding
schemes
This
is
useful
if
you
deal
with

which
have
been
created
with
another
operating
system
and
especially
if
the
language
is
not
English
and
has
many
accents
and
specific
characters
For
instance
the
standard
encoding
scheme
in
Linux
is
UTF

whereas
the

in

is
Latin1

Regular

A

strings
For
instance
one
could
have
the
following
pattern
2
digits
2
letters

4

R
provides
powerful

A
suggestion
for
future
development
on

Try
to
link
the
terms

robustness
The
latter
being
very
hard

pin
down

definition
even

don
t
use
the
same
definitions
for
robustness
on

level
Maybe
this
asks
for
a

about

alone
Were
the
difference

way
around

to

SAS
is
a
database
As
opposed
to
Relational
Databases
SAS
is
used
primarily
for
batch
processing
of
massive
amounts
of
data
It
can
be
found
http
www
sas
com
here
SAS
is
the
largest
privately
held
software
company
in
the
world
SAS
is
made
up
of
a
number
of
modules
with
specialized
procedures
for
analysis
relating
to
various
disciplines
The
foundation
of
the
software
is
the
Base
SAS
product
If
one
is
interested
in
producing
Graphical
output
it
would
be
necessary
to
purchase
a
license
to
SAS
Graph
Statistical
tools
are
in
SAS
Stat

are

There

Research
SAS
OR
and
many
more
that
could
be
mentioned
SAS
is
fundamentally
the
premier
data
analysis
software
on
the
market
today
It
utilizes
a
specialized
data
set
table
proprietary
to
SAS
however
the
SAS
System
has
modules
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
to
many
other
data
base
products
like
Oracle
and
ODBC
compliant
products
like
MS
SQL
Server
or
PROGRESS
SAS
is
generally
utilized
by
government
organizations
and
large
businesses
It
is
also
found
being
used
by
many
colleges
and
universities
The
greatest
use
for
research
is
hard
to
identify
but
there
has
been
a
great
focus
of
users
in
the
pharmacological
research
field
It
is
also
used
for
analysis
and
reporting
of
data
in
social
science
fields
and
engineering
companies
like
electric
utilities
SAS
licenses
tend
to
be
expensive
and
complicated
based
on
the
number
of
users
and
the
number
of
processors
in
the
host
computer
It
runs
on
server
environments
and
is
licencable
for
workstation
users
on
PCs
or
other
common
machines
It
does
not
run
on
Macintosh
machines
but
a
special

Changes
of
Parameter
Variables
When
a
procedure
is
invoked
with
variables
as
parameter
this
parameters
may
be
passed
in
one
of
the
following
ways
By
reference
also
known
as
by
name
which
means
changes
inside
the
procedure
alters
the
original
variable
By
value
or
as
dummy
which
means
changes
inside
the
procedure
alters
only
a
copy
of
the
original
variable
In
PL
I
a
variable
which
is
of
simple
type
e

an
array
of
simple

is
passed
by

if
and
only
if
the

matches
exactly
the

inside
the
procedure

Asterisk
Notation
If
the
size
attribute
of
the
parameter
definition
is
an
asterisk
every
matching
variable
with
any
size
is
passed
by
reference
If
the
dimension
of
the
parameter
definition
is
an
asterisk
every
matching
variable
with
any
dimension
is
passed
by
reference

This

Static
Linking
Making
a
program
executable
requires
two
steps
Compile
the
program
and
all
the
used
external
procedures
in
any
order
Use
the
linkage
editor
to
combine
the
compile
objects
to
an
executable
program
The
executable
program
now
contains
the
binary
code
of
its
procedures
at
linking
time
br
i
e
if
an
external
procedure
is
changed
and
recompiled
after
linking
time
this
would
not
change
the
behaviour
of
the
executable
program
Fetched
Procedures
PL
I
allows
dynamic
linking
of
external
procedures
br
i
e
a
main
program
may
load
the
last
compiled
version
of
a
procedure
at
run
time
The
statement
FETCH
ABC
loads
the
binary
of
procedure
ABC
from
auxiliary
storage
into
main
storage
unless
ABC
already
exists
in
main
storage
The
statement
RELEASE
ABC
frees
main
storage
occupied
by
ABC
sup

sup
example
proc
options
main
dcl
abc
EXT
ENTRY
dcl
dfg
EXT

dcl
b1
b2
bit

if
b1
then
do
fetch

call
abc
release
abc
end
if
b2
then
do
fetch
abc
dfg
call
abc
call
dfg
release
abc
dfg
end
end
example
Pseudo
Fetching
If
in
the
example
above
both
b1
and
b2
are
true
abc
will
be
released
after
the
first
call
abc
will
be
loaded
again
before
the
second
call
which
is
not
very
effective
PL
I
has
the
following
properties
A
procedure
will
be
recognised
as
to
be
loaded
dynamicly
iff
the
program
somewhere
contains
a
fetch
or
release
statement
it
is
not
necessary
that
this
statement
will
be
reached
at
any
time
If
a
procedure
recognised
as
to
be
loaded
dynamicly
is
invoked
at
runtime
it
will
be
fetched
automatically
if
necessary
Using
this
two
properties
the
program
above
may
be
rewritten
as
example
proc
options
main
dcl
abc
EXT
ENTRY
dcl
dfg
EXT
ENTRY
dcl
b1
b2
bit
1
if
1
2
then
this
will
never
be
true
fetch
abc
dfg
but
abc
and
dfg
will
be
MARKED
AS
TO
BE
LOADED
DYNAMICLY
if
b1
then
do
COMMENT
IF
ABC
IS
NOT
YET
IN
MAIN
STORAGE
THEN
LOAD
IT
AUTOMATICALLY
call
abc
end
if
b2
then
do
COMMENT
IF
ABC
IS
NOT
YET
IN
MAIN
STORAGE
THEN
LOAD
IT
AUTOMATICALLY
call
abc
COMMENT
IF
DFG
IS
NOT
YET
IN
MAIN
STORAGE
THEN
LOAD
IT
AUTOMATICALLY
call
dfg
end

Utility

As
the
name
suggest
polygonal
modeling
involves
constructing
the
models
out
of
polygons
Strictly
software
packages
works
only
with
triangles
Blender
could
show
you
quads
and
some
software
packages
could
even
let
you
work
with
polygons
with
more
than
4
sides
n
gons
but
these
packages
work
internally
only
with
triangles
These
triangles
are
hidden
so
that
you
could
concentrate
more
on
modeling
While
different
modelers
works
differently
they
would
still
follow
certain
workflows
some
call
this
techniques
These
are
familiarly
called
box
modeling
and
polygon
by
polygon
modeling
poly
by
poly
modeling
Box
modeling
is
a
top
down
approach
where
modelers
start
with
a
primitive
usually
a
cube
box
hence
the
box
in
box
modeling
Then
from
this
primitive
the
model
s
form
is
build
up
where
details
are
gradually
added
Poly
by
poly
modeling
is
almost
the
opposite
of
box
modeling
It
is
the
bottom
up
approach
where
modelers
start
with
a
plane
or
even
a
vertex
Using
extrusion
and
other
tools
more
geometries
are
added
Polygon
by
polygon
the
model
is
gradually
build
None
of
the
two
is
better
than
the
other
but
there
are
instances
where
one
workflow
lends
much
better
to
the
situation
One
typical
advantage
of
box
modeling
is
that
at
early
stage
you
are
able
to
conceive
first
the
form
the
whole
of
the
model
and
is
better
equipped
to
do
general
corrections
without
bothering
yet
with
the
details
Poly
by
poly
otherwise
give
you
more
control
on
the
geometry
and
is
much
more
easier
to
use
in
modeling
complex
forms
like
the
human
ear
Complications
do
arise
when
working
with
the
two
In
box
modeling
it
is
typically
difficult
to
manage
the
geometry
when
adding
details
Experience
is
necessary
so
as
not
to
create
a
mess
Poly
by
poly
modeling
otherwise
has
its
own
quirks
Since
you
are
going
detail
by
detail
it
is
easy
to
make
a
mess
with
the
models
form
i
e
wrong
proportions
While
the
two
are
opposites
they
compliment
each
other
beautifully
Most
modelers
would
combine
the
two
workflows
in
a
variety
of
proportions
combining
the
strength
of
each
For
example
one
might
model
a
human
body
using
box
modeling
while
the
head
and
the
ears
are
done
using
poly
by
poly
modeling
Blocking
with
primitives
is
added
to
enrich
approaches
is
modeling
It
is
basically
box
modeling
in
conjunction
with
divide
and
conquer
approach
Different
parts
are
modeled
separately
with
their
own
primitives
and
later
attached
with
the
others
to
form
the
whole

it
a

plant
with
orange

The
flowers
are
a
little

odd
shaped
with
a
spur
coming

It
is
usually

and
is
sometimes
even
called
a

Jewelweed
Another
name
for
it

Touch

It
got
this
name
because
the

Bullhead
Lily
is
a
yellow
flower
that
grows
in
the
shallow
water
of
ponds
The
leaves
are
large
and
heart
shaped

they
float
on
top
of
the
water
They
are
lily
pads
in
every
sense

the
word
The
inside
of
the
flower
is
usually
a
very
busy
place
for
insects
They
are
there
to
gather
the
flower
s
nectar
and
in
doing
so
they
pollinate
the
flower

flowers
grows
at

a
stem

pushes
the
blossom
a
couple
of
inches
higher
than
the
surface

of
water
If
you
wish
to
try
this
you
will
need
two
pots
of
boiling
water
one
large
and
one
small
When
they
are
both
boiling
drop
the
leaves
flowers
stems
or
young
seed
pods
into
the
smaller
pot
and
let
it
boil
for
about
a
minute
Then
pour
most
of
the
water
off
Add
more
boiling
water
to
the
small
pot
from
the
large
pot
and
boil
for
another
minute
Do
this
about
six
times
Then
add
butter
or
margarine
and
enjoy
the
feast

The

them
at

and
in

since
they
eat
so

it

Greeting
and
question
Hi
I
m
Eleraama
I
plan
to
study
this
course
to
get
a
basic
grasp
of
Manchu
and
so
I
think
this
is
the
perfect
opportunity
to
critique
the
book
from
a
learner
s
perspective
For
example
I
am
uncertain
that
the
discussion
of
vowel
harmony
belongs
here
and
not
in
its
own
section
having
literally
just
started
this
course
it
s
pretty
much
meaningless
to
me
and
looks
quite
scary
I
think
it
would
make
a
lot
more
sense
if
it
provided
example
words
or
was
placed
at
the
end
of
the
first
vocabulary
section
it
s
really
more
a
matter
of
construction
than
pronunciation
or
so
it
seems
to
me
with
five
minutes
of
Manchu
under
my
belt

Some
suggestions
for
further
improvements
The
first
sentence
of
Standards
seems
to
suggest
that
all
modeling
languages
mentioned
are
incarnations
of
MDA
which
is
of
course
not
true
in
Discussion
the
sentence
The
reusability
of
a
model
even
within
the
original
platform
Current
modeling
languages
contain
flaws
reused
code
usually
requires
debugging
for
a
new
application
is
not
very
clear
Suggested
improvement
Reuse
of
a
model
is
often
not
possible
without
modifying
the
original
model
and
hence
having
to
test
it
again
This
is
because
current
modeling
tools
and
standards
fail
to
enforce
strong
enough
decoupling
The
time
consumption
of
the
testing
period
the
process
of
deriving
platform
dependent
code
is
time
intensive
in
most
domains
It
is
not
clear
what
the
testing
period
has
to
do
with
the
process
of
deriving
platform
dependent
code
Maybe
this
should
be
split
into
two
points
Exhaustive
testing
might
still
be
necessary
if
the
model
does
not
capture
enough
detail
for
verification
or
verification
tools
are
not
available
The
time
required
for
defining
a
transformation
to
platform
dependent
code
may
by
far
outweigh
the
time
required
for
performing
the
transformation
manually

I
ve
been
wondering
about
ergative
etc
A
similar
situation
arose
over
at
BOOKNAME
Intermediate
Sounds
Phones
Vowels
where
it
only
mentioned
height
and
backness
I
didn
t
want
to
get
into
a
lot
of
fancy
stuff
that
feels
Advanced
but
it
didn
t
seem
right
that
a
reader
could
go
through
the
Intermediate
section
and
then
get
blown
away
trying
to
read
discussions
of
the
subject
because
they
haven
t
been
exposed
at
all
to
terms

like
to

I
have
a

to
touch
on
similarly
under

I

suggest
keeping
the

fairly
minimal

of
a

BlackStar
Point
to
Point
GPS
Navigation
for
BlackBerry
Introduction
Blackstar
is
a
free
application
that
runs
on
most
BlackBerry
smartphones
It
allows
the
user
to
use
the
built
in
GPS
or
an
external
Bluetooth
GPS
to
perform
point
to
point
navigation
It
also
has
a
series
of
Geocaching
specific
enhancements
that
allow
Premium
Geocaching
members
to
import
Pocket
Queries
or
extract
data
from
bcaching
com
Project
page
http
www
blackstarnavigation
com
Installation
and
support
The
software
may
be
downloaded
from
the
project
page
above
or
can
be
installed
from
Blackberry
App
World
Support
is
available
at
the
project
forums
which
can
also
be
found
at
the
project
page
Getting
your
first
GPS
Lock
When
you
start
BlackStar
it
will
attempt
to
get
your
location
using
whatever
GPS
is
set
up
on
your
device
While
the
lock
is
being
acquired
you
ll
see
a
count
on
the
screen
This
is
the
number
of
seconds
BlackStar
has
been
trying
to
acquire
a
GPS
lock
not
a
number
of
satellites
acquired
Once
it
accomplishes
the
lock
it
will
start
showing
your
GPS
coordinates
and
altitude
along
with
speed
and
a
compass
indicating
the
direction
you
are
moving
this
is
not
a
magnetic
compass
it
compares
your
current
location
to
your
last
few
location
to
interpolate
the
direction
you
are
moving
so
if
you
slow
down
too
much
or
stop
this
compass
will
just
start
spinning
off
in
random
directions
This
GPS
lock
may
take
some
time
several
minutes
and
generally
requires
a
clear
view
of
the
sky
The
GPS
can
sometimes
work
indoors
but
this
isn
t
generally
the
case
Even
a
heavy
tree
canopy
can
interfere
with
GPS
signal
and
in
large
cities
the
tall
buildings
can
block
access
to
all
but
a
few
satellites
making
a
lock
more
difficult
So
for
best
results
go
outside
and
enjoy
some
fresh
air
while
you
wait
for
your
first
lock
If
you
still
don
t
get
a
GPS
lock
there
are
several
things
that
can
be
causing
problems
GPS
Setup
To
verify
that
your
GPS
is
set
up
properly
on
your
BlackBerry
If
you
already
use
other
third
party
applications
that
use
the
GPS
like
Google
Maps
and
the
GPS
is
working
there
you
can
skip
to
Security
Obviously
your
phone
needs
to
be
set
up
with
a
GPS
unit
sorry
Pearl
users
and
you
need
to
allow
third
party
applications
to
use
it
This
setup
is
generally
found
under
Options
look
for
Advanced
Options
and
GPS
GPS
Services
must
be
set
to
ON
or
Location
ON
If
you
don
t
have
the
option
to
turn
this
on
you
either
don
t
have
a
GPS
on
board
or
your
carrier
has
disabled
it
contact
your
carrier
for
details
or
see
the
NOTE
below
Try
refreshing
the
GPS
from
this
screen
and
see
if
you
get
a
GPS
lock
Menu
Button
then
select
Refresh
GPS
For
Blackberries
that
lack
a
GPS
Receiver
like
the
Pearl
or
cases
where
your
carrier
has
disabled
access
to
the
GPS
Like
Verizon
OS
4
2
you
need
to
use
an
external
Bluetooth
GPS
receiver
If
your
GPS
is
not
acquiring
a
lock
after
this
try
a
battery
pull
NOTE
Verizon
and
probably
other
carriers
once
had
the
GPS
disabled
for
BlackBerry
devices
unless
you
purchased
their
Navigation
software
10
month
Verizon
has
supposedly
removed
this
lock
as
of
OS
4
5
so
if
you
have
a
Verizon
BlackBerry
and
you
don
t
pay
for
TeleNav
you
ll
need
to
upgrade
the
OS
for
BlackStar
or
any
third
party
GPS
application
to
work
with
your
internal
GPS
Security
Your
GPS
may
be
working
fine
but
you
also
need
to
give
BlackStar
access
to
it
If
you
still
can
t
see
your
location
in
BlackStar
after
verifying
your
GPS
receiver
works
check
your
application
permissions
and
make
sure
BlackStar
has
access
to
Location
GPS
under
Connections
From
the
Options
menu
go
to
Advanced
Options
then
Applications
Menu
click
on
BlackStar
and
select
Edit
Permissions
If
necessary
use
the
spacebar
to
open
the
Connections
section
and
look
for
Location
GPS
and
make
sure
that
is
set
to
ALLOW
Adding
Managing
Waypoints
Waypoints
can
generally
be
added
in
one
of
three
ways
Entering
Directly
From
the
BlackStar
main
screen
hit
the
menu
key
and
select
New

Enter
a
waypoint
name
your
desired
Lat

and
a

If

be
found
by
clicking
the

link
next

listed
on

s
main

On
the

Importing
a
GPX
or
LOC
file
from
an
SD
card
If
you
don
t
have
an
SD
card
for
your
BlackBerry
get
one
This
is
just
another
handy
thing
you
can
do
with
them
GPX
files
are
frequently
used
by
Premium
GeoCaching
com
members
to
download
lists
of
GeoCaches
for
paperless
caching
You
can
have
the
GPX
file
emailed
to
your
BlackBerry
and
save
it
to
your
SD
card
or
attach
your
BlackBerry
to
your
desktop
and
copy
it
from
there
To
import
GPX
files
from
the
BlackStar
main
screen
hit
menu
select
List
Waypoints
then
select
Import
GPX
LOC
File
Find
and
select
your
GPX
file
and
you
re
good
to
go
Be
careful
with
the
sizes
of
these
GPX
files
While
BlackStar
seems
to
be
able
to
handle
a
500
cache
query
every
time
you
go
to
list
the
caches
it
ll
try
to
sort
them
by
distance
which
means
it
has
to
calculate
the
distance
for
every
cache
in
your
current
list
With
200
or
more
caches
on
board
this
can
be
a
significant
wait
Special
note
Some
companies
require
non
media
files
to
be
encrypted
on
the
SD
card
In
this
case
you
may
need
to
save
the
GPX
file
to
your
music
or
video
folder
otherwise
the
BlackBerry
will
add
an
extension
to
the
filename
and
BlackStar
can
t
recognize
the
file
BCaching
com
Import
BCaching
com
also
allows
you
to
store
Pocket
Queries
from
Geocaching
com
on
their
site
if
you
are
a
Premium
Geocaching
member
You
can
even
set
the
Pocket
Queries
to
email
directly
to
your
BCaching
com
account
meaning
you
always
have
a
reasonably
current
list
of
GeoCaches
on
tap
at
your
BCaching
com
account
This
is
pretty
easy
to
set
up
and
you
can
just
create
a
few
automated
Pocket
Queries
that
run
every
day
or
two
and
always
have
lots
of
current
caches
ready
for
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
GeoCaching
You
have
to
set
up
an
account
with
BCaching
see
their
site
for
full
details
and
enter
your
BCaching
credentials
into
BlackStar
under
Options
bcaching
Once
this
is
set
up
BlackStar
can
pull
the
20
Geocaches
that
are
closest
to
your
current
position
from
BCaching
The
real
beauty
of
doing
it
this
way
is
that
the
distance
calculations
are
done
on
the
BCaching
site
and
are
very
fast
So
if
you
keep
your
BlackStar
waypoints
list
empty
BCaching
can
have
your
nearest
20
loaded
up
and
ready
to
go
very
quickly
You
have
to
have
a
GPS
lock
to
load
the
nearest
caches
from
BCaching
Once
you
have
a
lock
go
to
the
Waypoints
List
and
select
Get
closest
BCaching
GPX
Wait
for
the
x
caches
added
x
caches
updated
message
exit
the
Waypoints
List
and
go
back
in
to
force
BlackStar
to
sort
the
new
waypoints
by
distance
Note
When
you
cache
this
way
you
may
find
it
helpful
to
clear
your
waypoints
list
every
now
and
then
If
you
re
driving
around
loading
more
and
more
caches
into
BlackStar
you
ll
find
the
distance
calculations
take
longer
and
longer
20
waypoints
load
almost
instantly
200
can
take
a
frustrating
amount
of
time
Tip
If
your
Pocket
Queries
are
set
to
exclude
caches
you
ve
found
BCaching
will
have
no
way
of
taking
them
off
the
list
of
caches
to
find
Be
sure
your
PQ
includes
found
caches
so
BCaching
is
aware
you
ve
found
the
cache
Personally
I
use
weekly
queries
to
get
new
caches
and
I
have
a
daily
query
set
up
centered
at
my
home
coordinates
that
uploads
only
caches
I
ve
found
within
a
500
mile
radius
emailed
directly
to
my
BCaching
account
this
marks
caches
I
ve
found
overnight
so
they
don
t
show
up
the
next
day
on
BCaching
The
Hunt
Now
it
s
time
to
go
find
a
GeoCache
Selecting
a
Waypoint
When
you
open
the
list
waypoints
screen
it
will
sort
the
waypoints
by
distance
from
you
if
you
have
a
GPS
lock
It
will
also
indicate
the
approximate
direction
of
each
cache
The
direction
is
based
on
your
current
heading
the
direction
you
are
currently
moving
and
not
what
direction
your
BlackBerry
happens
to
be
pointed
So
if
you
re
standing
still
there
s
a
very
good
chance
the
directions
are
going
to
be
pretty
much
random
For
best
results
walk
a
little
distance
and
make
sure
the
compass
indicator
is
showing
your
approximate
direction
of
movement
before
loading
up
the
waypoints
screen
There
are
several
ways
to
decide
which
waypoint
you
want
to
find
next
Click
on
one
and
select
Waypoint
Details
to
see
the
description
of
the
Cache
You
can
also
select
Show
all
on
BBMaps
and
you
ll
see
your
nearest
waypoints
on
a
map
assuming
you
have
BlackBerry
Maps
installed
Once
you
ve
picked
the
waypoint
you
want
to
go
to
click
on
it
and
select
Set
as
Destination
Navigating
to
the
Waypoint
The
navigation
screen
will
show
you
a
compass
rose
with
a
red
arrow
pointing
to
the
cache
As
with
all
directional
functions
in
BlackStar
and
most
GPS
units
for
that
matter
this
direction
is
interpolated
from
repeated
readings
of
your
location
In
other
words
if
you
stop
moving
the
BlackBerry
has
no
way
of
knowing
which
way
is
forward
and
the
arrow
will
likely
start
to
spin
around
If
you
have
to
drive
to
the
waypoint
or
just
prefer
a
map
view
there
are
options
on
the
main
menu
to
see
the
waypoint
in
Google
Maps
or
BlackBerry
Maps
The
Final
Hunt
Once
you
reach
the
vicinity
of
the
waypoint
there
are
several
hunting
tips
to
keep
in
mind
The
arrow
is
at
the
risk
of
sounding
repetitive
on
this
point
only
accurate
when
you
are
moving
in
a
straight
line
If
you
stop
or
move
in
erratic
directions
it
becomes
useless
fast
You
can
counter
this
by
using
one
of
two
techniques
Walk
briskly
in
a
straight
line
for
at
least
10
feet
This
will
calibrate
the
arrow
for
you
Ignore
the
arrow
and
look
at
the
distance
to
waypoint
If
the
number
is
getting
smaller
you
re
headed
in
approximately
the
right
direction
The
BlackBerry
like
all
GPS
units
is
only
accurate
to
about
3
meters
or
approximately
9
feet
under
ideal
conditions
Tree
canopy
large
buildings
and
even
a
heavy
cloud
cover
can
interfere
with
GPS
signal
reception
and
increase
that
error
considerably
Also
the
original
coordinates
may
be
off
due
to
the
same
issues
So
once
you
get
to
within
about
20
feet
or
so
don
t
depend
on
the
GPS
as
much
Found
it
Once
you
ve
found
the
cache
you
can
log
it
by
selecting
Log
Cache
Online
from
the
menu
This
will
take
you
to
the
Geocaching
com
mobile
site
with
the
log
page
for
your
cache
preloaded
You
may
have
to
log
in
to
Geocaching
com
of
course
This
will
not
delete
the
cache
from
your
GPX
file
or
BCaching
so
if
you
load
your
nearest
from
BCaching
you
ll
see
the
same
cache
all
over
again
Keep
track
of
what
you
ve
found
for
the
day
Miscellaneous
helpful
hints
GPS
and
battery
life
The
GPS
is
a
very
power
hungry
device
and
will
drain
your
battery
in
a
matter
of
hours
If
you
want
your
BlackBerry
to
live
through
a
full
day
of
caching
it
s
helpful
to
only
run
the
GPS
when
you
need
it
Once
you
know
approximately
where
your
GeoCache
is
turn
off
BlackStar

so
the

can
shut
down
for

unless
you
need

of

It
s
nice
having
an
indicator
that
you
are
9
miles

etc
but
shutting
down
the

until
you
really

might
mean

Vectors
Before
getting
into
vectors
it
is
important
to
know
the
difference
between
a
Scalar
and
a
Vector
br
A
Scalar
is
a
quantity
with
only
a
magnitude
For
example
the
number
of
fingers
I
have
is
a
scalar
as
is
the
distance
I
have
walked
br
A
Vector
is
a
quantity
with
a
magnitude
and
a
direction
for
example
Displacement
is
the
direction
I
have
traveled
and
the
distance
br
We
represent
a
vector
with
an
arrow
add
pic
when
i
have
the
rights
br
The
beginning
of
the
vector
is
the
tail
and
the
end
of
the
vector
where
it
points
to
is
the
head
We
indicate
a
vector
using
the
points
it
goes
from
and
to
for
example
in
our
picture
our
vector
goes
from
point
A
to
point
B
so
we
could
write
it
as
math
overrightarrow
A
B
math
Alternatively
we
can
indicate
it
similar
to
a
variable
in
algebra
as
a
letter
However
we
either
bold
it
or
draw
a
line
underneath
it
to
indicate
that
it
is
a
vector
not
an
ordinary
variable
For
example
we
could
call
it
math
underline
u
math
Vector
Math
Addition
When
adding
vectors
we
simply
join
them
together
head
to
tail

The

I

because
I
wouldn

If
you
leave
ribs
to
other
people
or
don
t
do
ribs
at
all
this
guide
will
help
you
start
making
your
own
ribs
Cooking
Never
boil
ribs
Boil
ribs
and
you
lose
Just
pretend
the
ribs
were
a
nice
juicy
ribeye
Then
would
you
boil
it
I
didn
t
think
so
If
you
don
t
want
to
have
to
pay
attention
to
a
smoker
or
a
grill
all
day
long
then
do
it
in
a
275
oven
Whatever
you
do
do
not
BOIL
ribs
Just
step
away
from
a
person
that
says
you
should
boil
ribs
See
since
water
leaches
all
the
flavor
from
them
you
ll
be
eating
something
like
wet
paper
If
the
weather
isn
t
very
good
for
grilling
then
just
place
a
roasting
rack
in
a
roasting
pan
and
place
wood
chips
under
it
Just
be
sure
to
open
a
window
and
turn
on
a
fan
just
in
case
Also
keep
a
fire
extinguisher
around
Seasoning
Rubs
are
classic
rib
seasonings
There
are
some
pretty
good
rubs
on
this
website
but
avoid
salt
based
commercial
rubs
If
you
can
t
find
one
that
you
like
just
make
your
own
Things
that
work
well
in
rubs
include
paprika
chipotle
powder
garlic
cayenne
pepper
brown
sugar
chili
powder
and
smoke
powder
Rubs
make
a
nice
crust
on
the
surface
of
the
meat
and
a
good
one
will
make
you
look
like
a
pro
Sauces
Don
t
put
a
sauce
on
the
meat
before
you
cook
it
The
sauce
will
burn
and
the
meat
will
either
be
underdone
or
still
tough
Just
brush
on
a
sauce
generously
once
it
s
done
cooking
then
place
it
on
a
grill
or
under
the
broiler
Even
then
you
don
t
want
to
use
a
commercial
sugar
based
sauce
If
you
look
at
the
ingredients
the
first
thing
you
ll
see
is
high
fructose
corn
syrup
then
tomato
then
more
sugar
then
oil
salt
etc
Homemade
sauces
are
much
less
sugary
and
aren
t
that
hard
to
make
Rib
Cuts
Think
all
ribs
are
the
same
Wrong
There
are
3
different
cuts
of
ribs
baby
back
loin
back
ribs
spareribs
and
St
Louis
ribs
The
baby
back
is
a
little
more
tender
than
the
other
ribs
takes
flavor
well
and
cooks
faster
The
sparerib
is
a
little
tougher
has
a
little
cartilage
has
a
bit
more
meat
on
it
and
takes
longer
to
cook
The
St
Louis
rib
is
just
a
sparerib
with
the
tips
and
cartilage
removed
Hopefully
you
will
get
to
work
on
some
of
your
own
lip
smacking
ribs
Building
AROS
in
Different
Directories
It
is
possible
and
the
preferred
method
to
configure
and
build
AROS
in
a
directory
other
than
the
working
copy
For
example
source
lang
bash
svn
co
https
svn
aros
org
svn
aros
trunk
AROS
aros
src
cd
aros
src
mkdir
build
cd
build
aros
src
configure
with
options
as
appropriate
make
source
puts
the
AROS
working
copy
in
the
directory
aros
src
and
builds
it
in
a
separate
parallel
directory
build
Why
would
you
want
to
do
this
Well
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
You
may
want
to
separate
the
source
and
object
code
and
only
backup
the
source
avoid
polluting
the
working
copy
with
files
generated
during
the
build
You
may
want
to
put
the
build
directory
and
the
working
copy
on
different
physical
disks
to
improve
performance
You
may
want
to
remote
mount
the
working
copy
on
multiple
machines
and
build
for
different
machines
from
the
same
working
copy
You
may
want
to
build
multiple
configurations
from
the
same
working
copy
and
at
the
same
time
The
last
reason
above
is
possibly
the
most
useful
For
instance
you
can
have
builds
for
separate
architectures
and
or
debug
builds
each
using
the
same
working
copy
Using
multiple
build
directories
you
can
rebuild
any
or
all
configurations
after
an
edit
without
the
need
to
either
clean
and
reconfigure
or
identify
and
copy
changes
into
another
working
copy
NB
If
you
have
previously
built
AROS
inside
the
working
copy
you
will
need
to
delete
all
obsolete
generated
files
from
the
source
tree
before
attempting
to
configure
build
in
another
directory
The
reason
for
this
is
some
parts
will
detect
the
existing
file
in
the
source
tree
before
the
correct
version
and
attempt
to
use
that
It
is
best
to
delete
the
bin
directory
as
well
as
all
files
that
shouldnt
exist
when
the
following
command
is
used
code
svn
status
no
ignore
code
Delete
any
files
which
are
ignored
not
supposed
to
be
there
unless
they
are
your
own
projects
files
TIP
If
you
are
compiling
multiple
AROS
builds
from
the
same
working
dir
the
following
configure
option
will
make
them
use
a
common
location
to
download
external
sources
to
code
with
portssources
path
to
common
location
code
It
is
best
to
use
a
separate
directory
outside
of
both
the
working
dir
and
build
dir
s
to
store
these
files
so
that
if
you
delete
a
build
or
the
working
dir
you
will
still
have
the
files
and
not
need
to
download
them
every
time

George
W
Bush
held
the
office
of
President
of
the
United
States
of
America
when
the
September
11
terrorism
acts
were
carried
out
in
2001
Osama
bin
Laden
a
militant
Saudi
Arabian
muslim
soon
claimed
responsibility
for
the
act
He
had
been
forced
to
leave
Sudan
after
attacks
on
a
US
embassy
and
the
USS
Cole
and
sought
haven
with
the
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
The
US
government
demanded
that
the
Taliban
hand
Osama
bin
Laden
unconditionally
over
but
when
they
refused
the
US
military
invaded
the
country
to
capture
the
heads
of
the
terrorist
organisation
al
Qaeda
which
Osama
was
said
to
lead
The
initial
invasion
appeared
to
be
a
success
and
coalition
forces
soon
gained
control
of
Kabul
Soon
however
it
became
apparent
that
the
country
was
not
quite
won
yet
warlords
swept
in
to
fill
the
power
void
and
the
Taliban
regrouped
Eight
years
later
there
are
few
prospects
for
peace
in
that
war
torn
country
While
the
Bush
administration
was
eager
to
explain
that
its
War
on
Terror
was
in
no
way
a
war
on
Islam
not
all
were
convinced
Calling
the
incursion
into
Afghanistan
a
crusade
was
a
sore
spot
for
some
Muslims

after

the
relationship
between
the
US

also
publicly

IMPACT
ON
AUTHOR
I
was
particularly
interested
in
JUMP
because
they
are
an
advocate
for
peace
in
what
is
seemingly
a
tangible
and
meaningful
way
The
notion
of
a
Ministry
of
Peace
that
works
closely
with
Japanese
law
makers
to
develop
and
implement
legislation
and
policies
aimed
at
cultivating
national
and
international
peace
was
refreshing
I
thought
that
it
was
an
interesting
idea
to
consider
what
that
would
like
here
in
the
United
States
That
is
a
Department
of
Peace
that
works
closely
with
the
U
S
President
to
develop
domestic
and
foreign
policies
that
fully
consider
the
importance
of
preserving
and
advancing
the
principles
of
peace
as
well
as
partnering
with
the
President
and
other
law
makers
to
construct
peaceful
alternatives
to
international
conflict
I
believe
that
the
current
political
and
diplomatic
climate
is
one
that
is
incredibly
tenuous
There
are
a
wide
and
varied
range
of
very
serious
issues
brewing
all
across
the
world
stage
such
as
the
U
S
Wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Iran
s
pursuit
of
nuclear
energy
the
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict
North
Korea
s
testing
of
nuclear
missiles
the
issue
of
nuclear
disarmament
pressure
for
UN
reform
U
S
strained
relationships
with
Russia
Cuba
etc
just
to
name
a
few
When
you
look
closely
at
international
relations
and
present
day
issues
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
peace
that
exists
is
fragile
and
that
there
are
many
opportunities
for
international
conflict
I
believe
that
the
establishment
of
Ministries
or
Departments
of
Peace
in
every
country
is
potentially
an
important
first
step
towards
meaningful
lasting
global
peace

hips
rich
in

Introduction
Cells
are
organized
to
form
tissues
and
tissues
are
organised
to
form
organs
Tissues
are
formed
by
an
aggregation
of
like
cells
carrying
out
a

function
Cells
are
linked
together
by
cell
junctions
and
are
supported
by
a
matrix

they
themselves
secrete
The
cell
junctions
are
basicaly
of
three

shows
an
area
of
the
luminal
surface
of
the
telencephalon
which
has
a
junctional
complex
and
pinocytotic
vesicles
The
junctional
complex
is
divided
into
three
types
of
junctions
1
the
most
apical
is
the
tight
junction
which
controls
and
or
restricts
the
movement
of
molecules
across
epithelial
layers
and
helps
maintain
polarity
2
the
zonula
adherens
and
3
the
desmosome
which
is
a
spot
junction
The
pinocytotic
vesicles
are
formed
from
coated
pits
in
the
plasma
membrane
and
are
involved
in
endocytosis
It
is
the
junctions
that
allow
individual
cells
to
be
organized
into
tissues
Numerous
proteins
called
cell
adhesion
molecules
CAMs
have
been
identified
and
the
illustrations
shown
really
represent
a
generqalization
These
proteins
are
being
intensively
studied
because
of
their
importance
in
cancer
and
the
embryonic
development
organization
of
the
nervous
system
According
to
Ganong
the
proteins
can
be
divided
into
four
large
groups
integrins
IgG
superfamily
cadhedrins
and
selectins
A
Biochemistry
text

The
tight
junctions
can
be
found
at
the
apexes
of
many
lumen
epithelial
cells
and
forms
a
water
tight
occlusion
that
prevents
leaking
of
water
substrates
and
ions
from
the
extra
cellular
fluid
to
the
lumen
That
having
been
said
there
is
evidence
that
some
tight
junctions
are
more
leaky
than
others
and
that
this
leakiness
is
under
hormonal
control
Desmosomes
and
Zona
Adherens
junctions
hold
cells
together
The
Zona
Adherens
is
a
continuous
band
whereas
Desmosomes
are
more
in
the
nature
of
a
spot
weld
They
allow
passage
of
some
substances
between
the
cells
Gap
junction

direct
communication
from
cell
to

They
are
found
in
many
epithelial
cells

most
famously
they
exist
in
Cardiac

and

This
image
of
the
luminal
surface
of
the
telencephalon
shows
junctional
complexes
and
pinocytotic
vesicles
The
junctional
complex
is
divided
into
three
types
of
junctions
1
the
most
apical
is
the
tight
junction
which
controls
and
or
restricts
the
movement
of
molecules
across
epithelial
layers
and
helps
maintain
polarity
2
the
zonula
adherens
which
also
includes
the
numerous
actin
filaments
seen
in
the
apical
cytoplasm
and
3
the
desmosome
which
is
a
spot
junction
The
pinocytotic
vesicles
are
formed
from
coated
pits
in
the
plasma
membrane
and
are
involved
in

A
brief
description
is

More
detail
is

in
the
sections
dealing
with
different
orga
types
Exchange
Epithelia
Thin
flattened
cells
that
allow
the
easy
exchange
of
gasses
These
are
found
in
he
capillaries
and
the
lungs
Transport
Epithelia
These
epithelia
are
found
lining
the
the
tubes
of
the
intestine
and
the
kidney
The
cells
are
usually
columnar
and
regulate
the
exchange
of
nutrients
an
ions
The
apical
surface
usually
has
microvilli
fingerlike
projections
that
can
increase
the
absorptive
area
up
to
100X
These
cells
are
usually
bound
together
with
tight
junctions
These
cells
usually
have
a
high
metabolism
numerous
mitochondria
Protective
Epithelia
Prevent
exchange
between
the
internal
and
external
environment
examples
include
skin
linings
of
upper
respiratory
system
mouth
oesaphagus
urethra
vagina
Ciliated
epithelia
Line
parts
of
the
respiratory
system
where
they
propel
mucous
laden
with
particulate
matter
out
of
the
lung
and
the
fallopian
tube
where
they
waft
the
ovum
to
the
uterus
Secretion
epithelia
Form
either
exocrine
or
endocrine
glands
Connective

Introduction
Style
is
an
often
overlooked
but
very
critical
attribute
of
writing
The
style
of
writing
directly
impacts
the
readability
and
understandability
of
the
end
product
The
style
of
programming
as
the
writing
of
source
code
in
a
computer
language
also
suffers
from
this
neglect
Programs
need
to
be
readable
and
understandable
by
humans
not
just
comparable
by
machines
This
requirement
is
important
in
the
creation
of
quality
products
that
not
only
meet
user
needs
but
also
can
be
developed
on
schedule
and
within
estimated
cost
This
book
is
intended
to
help
the
computer
professional
produce
better
Ada
programs
It
presents
a
set
of
specific
stylistic
guidelines
for
using
the
powerful
features
of
Ada
95
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
in
a
disciplined
manner
Each
guideline
consists
of
a
concise
statement
of
the
principles
that
should
be
followed
and
a
rationale
for
following
the
guideline
In
most
cases
an
example
of
the
use
of
the
guideline
is
provided
and
in
some
cases
a
further
example
is
included
to
show
the
consequences
of
violating
the
guideline
Possible
exceptions
to
the
application
of
the
guideline
are
explicitly
noted
and
further
explanatory
notes
are
provided
where
appropriate
In
some
cases
an
instantiation
is
provided
to
show
more
specific
guidance
that
could
be
enforced
as
a
standard
In
selected
cases
automation
notes
discuss
how
one
could
automate
enforcement
of
the
guideline
Ada
was
designed
to
support
the
development
of
high
quality
reliable
reusable
and
portable
software
For
a
number
of
reasons
no
programming
language
can
ensure
the
achievement
of
these
desirable
objectives
on
its
own
For
example
programming
must
be
embedded
in
a
disciplined
development
process
that
addresses
requirements
analysis
design
implementation
verification
validation
and
maintenance
in
an
organized
way
The
use
of
the
language
must
conform
to
good
programming
practices
based
on
well
established
software
engineering
principles
This
book
is
intended
to
help
bridge
the
gap
between
these
principles
and
the
actual
practice
of
programming
in
Ada
Many
of
the
guidelines
in
this
book
are
designed
to
promote
clear
source
text
The
goal
of
these
guidelines
is
to
improve
the
ease
of
program
evolution
adaptation
and
maintenance
Understandable
source
text
is
more
likely
to
be
correct
and
reliable
Easy
adaptation
requires
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
software
this
is
considerably
facilitated
by
clarity
Effective
code
adaptation
is
a
prerequisite
to
code
reuse
a
technique
that
has
the
potential
for
drastic
reductions
in
system
development
cost
Finally
because
maintenance
really
evolution
is
a
costly
process
that
continues
throughout
the
life
of
a
system
clarity
plays
a
major
role
in
keeping
maintenance
costs
down
Over
the
entire
life
cycle
code
has
to
be
read
and
understood
far
more
often
than
it
is
written
thus
the
investment
in
writing
readable
understandable
code
is
worthwhile
The
remaining
sections
of
this
introduction
discuss
the
organization
of
this
book
and
how
the
material
presented
can
be
used
by
people

The
format
of

The
style
guide
is
divided
into
sections
that
map
to
the
major
decisions
that
each
programmer
must
make
when
creating
high
quality
reliable
reusable
and
portable
Ada
software
Some
overlap
exists
in
the
sections
because
not
all
programming
decisions
can
be
made
independently
Individual
chapters
address

presentation
readability
program
structure
programming
practices
concurrency
portability

and
performance
and
a
new
chapter
addresses

Each
chapter
ends
with
a
summary
of
the
guidelines

contains
The
last
chapter
shows
a
complete
implementation
of
the
Dining

example
provided
by
Dr
Michael
B
Feldman
and
Mr
Bjorn
Kallberg
Many
of
the
guidelines
in
this
book
were
used
to
create
this
example
An
appendix
provides
a
cross
reference
matrix
between
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
sections
and
the
guidelines
in
this
style
guide
This
book
is
written
using
the
general
software
engineering
vocabulary
developed
over
the
last
20
years
Software
engineering
is
a
rapidly
evolving
discipline
with
relatively
new
concepts
and
terminology
However
to
establish
a
common
frame
of
reference
needed
definitions
are
extracted
from
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
and
Rationale
1995
Throughout
the
book
references
are
made
to
other
sources
of
information
about
Ada
style
and
other
Ada
issues
The
references
are
listed
at
the
end
of
the
book
A
bibliography
is
also
provided
In
this
book
the
term
Ada
refers
to
the
latest
Ada
standard
released
in
February

also
known
as

Presentation
and
Readability
Chapters
2
and
3
directly
address
the
issues
of
creating
clear
readable
and
understandable
source
text
Chapter
2
focuses
on
code
formatting
and
Chapter
3
addresses
issues
of
use
of
comments
naming
conventions
and
types
There
are
two
main
aspects
of
code
clarity
1
careful
and
consistent
layout
of
the
source
text
on
the
page
or
the
screen
covered
by
Chapter
2
that
can
enhance
readability
dramatically
2
careful
attention
to
the
structure
of
code
covered
by
Chapter
3
that
can
make
the
code
easier
to
understand
This
is
true
both
on
the
small
scale
e
g
by
careful
choice
of
identifier
names
or
by
disciplined
use
of
loops
and
on
the
large
scale
e
g
by
proper
use
of
packages
These
guidelines
treat
both
layout
and
structure
Code
formatting
and
naming
convention
preferences
tend
to
be
very
personal
You
must
balance
your
personal
likes
and
dislikes
with
those
of
other
engineers
on
the
project
so
that
you
can
agree
to
a
consistent
set
of
conventions
that
the
whole
project
team
will
follow
Automatic
code
formatters
can
help
in
enforcing
this
kind
of
consistency
Program
Structure
Chapter
4
addresses
overall
program
structure
Proper
structure
improves
program
clarity
This
is
analogous
to
readability
on
lower
levels
and
includes
issues
of
high
level
structure
in
particular
the
use
of
packages
and
child
packages
visibility
and
exceptions
The
majority
of
the
guidelines
in
this
chapter
are
concerned
with
the
application
of
sound
software
engineering
principles
such
as
information
hiding
abstraction
encapsulation
and
separation
of
concerns
Programming
Practices
Chapter
5
presents
guidelines
that
define
consistent
and
logical
language
feature
usage
These
guidelines
address
optional
parts
of
the
syntax
types
data
structures
expressions
statements
visibility
exceptions
and
erroneous
execution
Concurrency
Chapter
6
defines
the
correct
use
of
concurrency
to
develop
predictable
reliable
reusable
and
portable
software
The
topics
include
tasking
protected
units
communication
and
termination
One
major
area
of
enhancement
of
the
Ada
language
has
been
better
support
for
shared
data
The
task
mechanism
had
been
the
only
available
approach
to
protecting
shared
data
The
guidelines
in
this
chapter
support
the
use
of
protected
types
to
encapsulate
and
synchronize
access
to
shared
data
Portability
and
Reusability
Chapters
7
and
8
address
issues
of
designing
for
change
from
slightly
different
perspectives
Chapter
7
addresses
the
fundamentals
of
portability
the
ease
of
changing
software
from
one
computer
system
or
environment
to
another
and
the
impact
of
specific
feature
usage
on
portability
Chapter
8
addresses
code
reusability
the
extent
to
which
code
can
be
used
in
different
applications
with
minimal
change
The
portability
guidelines
discussed
in
Chapter
7
need
careful
attention
Adherence
to
them
is
important
even
if
the
need
to
port
the
resulting
software
is
not
currently
foreseen
Following
the
guidelines
improves
the
potential
reusability
of
the
resulting
code
in
projects
that
use
different
Ada
implementations
You
should
insist
that
when
particular
project
needs
force
the
relaxation
of
some
of
the
portability
guidelines
nonportable
features
of
the
source
text
are
prominently
indicated
The
reusability
guidelines
given
in
Chapter
8
are
based
on
the
principles
of
encapsulation
and
design
for
change
These
guidelines
stress
that
understanding
and
clarity
robustness
adaptability
and
independence
are
useful
and
desirable
even
when
reuse
is
not
expected
because
the
resulting
code
is
more
resistant
to
both
planned
and
unplanned
change
Object
Oriented
Features
Chapter
9
defines
a
set
of
guidelines
in
common
objected
oriented
terms
that
exploit
some
of
the
features
of
Ada
95
that
are
not
in
Ada
83
The
guidelines
discuss
the
use
of
the
new
Ada
features
of
type
extension
tagged
types
abstract
tagged
types
and
abstract
subprograms
to
implement
single
inheritance
multiple
inheritance
and
polymorphism
Performance
Chapter
10
defines
a
set
of
guidelines
intended
to
enhance
performance
It
is
recognized
that
some
approaches
to
performance
are
at
odds
with
maintainability
and
portability
Most
of
the
guidelines
in
this
chapter
read
when
measured
performance
indicates
Indicates
means
that
you
have
determined
that
the
benefit
in
increased
performance
to
your
application
in
your
environment
outweighs
the
negative
side
effects
on
understandability
maintainability
and
portability
of
the
resulting
code
How
To
Use
This
Book
This
book
is
intended
for
those
involved
in
the
actual
development
of
software
systems
written
in
Ada
The
following
sections
discuss
how
to
make
the
most
effective
use
of
the
material
presented
Readers
with
different
levels
of
Ada
experience
or
different
roles
in
a
software
project
will
need
to
use
the
book
in
different
ways
There
are
a
number
of
ways
in
which
this
book
can
be
used
as
a
guide
to
good
Ada
style
as
a
comprehensive
list
of
guidelines
that
will
contribute
to
better
Ada
programs
or
as
a
reference
work
to
consult
for
usage
examples
of
and
design
tradeoff
discussion
on
specific
features
of
the
language
The
book
contains
many
guidelines
some
of
which
are
quite
complex
Learning
them
all
at
the
same
time
should
not
be
necessary
it
is
unlikely
that
you
will
be
using
all
the
features
of
the
language
at
once
However
it
is
recommended
that
all
programmers
and
where
possible
other
Ada
project
staff
make
an
effort
to
read
and
understand
Chapters
2

4
and
Chapter
5
up
to
Section

Some
of
the
material
is
quite
difficult

2
which
discusses
visibility
but
it
covers
issues
that
are
fundamental
to
the
effective
use
of
Ada
and
is
important
for
any
software
professional
involved
in
building
Ada
systems
This
book
is
not
intended
as
an
introductory
text
on
Ada
or
as
a
complete
manual
of
the
Ada
language
It
is
assumed
that
you
already
know
the
syntax
of
Ada
and
have
a
rudimentary
understanding
of
the
semantics
With
such
a
background
you
should
find
the
guidelines
useful
informative
and
often
enlightening
If
you
are
learning
Ada
you
should
equip
yourself
with
a
comprehensive
introduction
to
the
language
Two
good
introductory
texts
on
Ada
83
are
Barnes
1989
and
Cohen
1986
Both
authors
have
published
new
books
that
cover
Ada

Barnes
1996
Cohen

Once
you
become
familiar
with
these
texts
you
are
encouraged
to
use
them
in
conjunction
with
Rationale
1995
The
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
should
be
regarded
as
a
companion
to
these
books
The
majority
of
guidelines
reference
the
sections
of
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
that
define
the
language
features
being
discussed
Appendix
A
cross
references
sections
of

Reference

guidelines
To
The
New
Ada
Programmer
At
first
sight
Ada
offers
a
bewildering
variety
of
features
It
is
a
powerful
tool
intended
to
solve
difficult
problems
and
almost
every
feature
has
a
legitimate
application
in
some
context
This
makes
it
especially
important
to
use
Ada
s
features
in
a
disciplined
and
organized
way
Following
the
guidelines
can
make
learning
Ada
easier
and
help
you
to
master
its
apparent
complexity
From
the
beginning
you
can
write
programs
that
exploit
the
best
features
of
the
language
in
the
way
that
the
designers
intended
Programmers
experienced
in
using
other
programming
languages
are
often
tempted
to
use
Ada
as
if
it
were
their
familiar
language
but
with
irritating
syntactic
differences
This
pitfall
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs
it
can
lead
to
convoluted
code
that
subverts
exactly
those
aspects
of
Ada
that
make
it
so
suitable
for
building
high
quality
systems
You
must
learn
to
think
Ada
Following
the
guidelines
in
this
book
and
reading
the
examples
of
their
use
will
help
you
to
do
this
as
quickly
and
painlessly
as
possible
To
some
degree
novice
programmers
learning
Ada
have
an
advantage
Following
the
guidelines
from
the
beginning
helps
in
developing
a
clear
programming
style
that
effectively
exploits
the
language
If
you
are
in
this
category
it
is
recommended
that
you
adopt
the
guidelines
for
those
exercises
you
perform
as
part
of
learning
Ada
Initially
developing
sound
programming
habits
by
concentrating
on
the
guidelines
themselves
and
their
supporting
examples
is
more
important
than
understanding
the
rationale
for
each
guideline
The
rationale
for
many
of
the
guidelines
helps
experienced
programmers
understand
and
accept
the
suggestions
presented
in
the
guideline
Some
of
the
guidelines
themselves
are
also
written
for
the
experienced
programmer
who
must
make
engineering
tradeoffs
This
is
especially
true
in
the
areas
of
portability
reusability
and
performance
These
more
difficult
guidelines
and
rationale
will
make

decision
You

To
The
Experienced
Ada
Programmer
As
an
experienced
Ada
programmer
you
are
already
writing
code
that
conforms
to
many
of
the
guidelines
in
this
book
In
some
areas
however
you
may
have
adopted
a
personal
programming
style
that
differs
from
that
presented
here
and
you
might
be
reluctant
to
change
Carefully
review
those
guidelines
that
are
inconsistent
with
your
current
style
make
sure
that
you
understand
their
rationale
and
consider
adopting
them
The
overall
set
of
guidelines
in
this
book
embodies
a
consistent
approach
to
producing
high
quality
programs
that
would
be
weakened
by
too
many
exceptions
Consistency
is
another
important
reason
for
general
adoption
of
common
guidelines
If
all
the
staff
of
a
project
write
source
text
in
the
same
style
many
critical
project
activities
are
easier
Consistent
code
simplifies
formal
and
informal
code
reviews
system
integration
code
reuse
within
a
project
and
the
provision
and
application
of
supporting
tools
In
practice
corporate
or
project
standards
may
require
deviations
from
the
guidelines
to
be
explicitly
commented
so
adopting
a
nonstandard
approach
may
require
extra
work
Some
of
the
guidelines
in
this
book
particularly
in
the
chapters
on
concurrency
portability
reusability
object
oriented
features
and
performance
focus
on
design
tradeoffs
These
guidelines
ask
you
to
consider
whether
using
an
Ada
feature
is
an
appropriate
design
decision
for
your
application
There
are
often
several
ways
to
implement
a
particular
design
decision
and
these
guidelines
discuss
the
tradeoffs
you
should
consider
in
making
your
decision
To
Experienced
Object
Oriented
Programmers
As
an
experienced
object
oriented
programmer
you
will
appreciate
the
effort
that
has
gone
into
elegantly
extending
the
Ada
language
to
include
powerful
object
oriented
features
These
new
features
are
integrated
tightly
with
the
existing
language
features
and
vocabulary
This
book
is
intentionally
written
to
provide
a
view
from
the
perspective
of
style
therefore
Ada
object
oriented
features
are
used
throughout
the
book
Disciplined
use
of
these
features
will
promote
programs
that
are
easier
to
read
and
modify
These
features
also
give
you
flexibility
in
building
reusable
components
Chapter
9
addresses
object
oriented
programming
and
the
issues
of
inheritance
and
polymorphism
Earlier
chapters
cross
reference
the
Chapter
9
guidelines
You
will
find
it
easier
to
take
advantage
of
many
of
the
concepts
in
Chapter
9
if
you
have
done
an
object
oriented
design
The
results
of
an
object
oriented
design
would
include
a
set
of
meaningful
abstractions
and
hierarchy
of
classes
The
abstractions
need
to
include
the
definition
of
the
design
objects
including
structure
and
state
the
operations
on
the
objects
and
the
intended
encapsulation
for
each
object
The
details
on
designing
these
abstractions
and
the
hierarchy
of
classes
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
book
A
number
of
good

exist

this

Manager
Technical
management
plays
a
key
role
in
ensuring
that
the
software
produced
in
the
course
of
a
project
is
correct
reliable
maintainable
and
portable
Management
must
create
a
project
wide
commitment
to
the
production
of
high

code
define
project
specific
coding
standards
and
guidelines
foster
an
understanding
of
why
uniform
adherence
to
the
chosen
coding
standards
is
critical
to
product
quality
and
establish
policies
and
procedures
to
check
and
enforce
that
adherence
The
guidelines
contained
in
this
book
can
aid
such
an
effort
An
important
activity
for
managers
is
the
definition
of
coding
standards
for
a
project
or
organization
These
guidelines
do
not
in
themselves
constitute
a
complete
set
of
standards
however
they
can
serve
as
a
basis
for
standards
Several
guidelines
indicate
a
range
of
decisions
but
they
do
not
prescribe
a
particular
decision
For
example
the
second
guideline
in
the
book
Guideline

advocates
using
a
consistent
number
of
spaces
for
indentation
and
indicates
in
the
rationale
that
two
to
four
spaces
would
be
reasonable
With
your
senior
technical
staff
you
should
review
each
such
guideline
and
arrive
at
a
decision
about
its
instantiation
that
will
constitute
your
project
or
organizational
standard
Two
other
areas
require
managerial
decisions
about
standardization

advises
you
to
avoid
arbitrary
abbreviations
in
object
or
unit
names
You
should
prepare
a
glossary
of
acceptable
abbreviations
for
a
project
that
allows
the
use
of
shorter
versions
of
application
specific
terms
e
g
FFT
for
Fast
Fourier
Transform
or
SPN
for
Stochastic
Petri
Net
You
should
keep
this
glossary
short
and
restrict
it
to
terms
that
need
to
be
used
frequently
as
part
of
names
Having
to
refer
continually
to
an
extensive
glossary
to
understand
source
text
makes
it
hard
to
read
The
portability
guidelines
given
in
Chapter
7
need
careful
attention
Adherence
to
them
is
important
even
if
the
need
to
port
the
resulting
software
is
not
currently
foreseen
Following
the
guidelines
improves
the
potential
reusability
of
the
resulting
code
in
projects
that
use
different
Ada
implementations
You
should
insist
that
when
particular
project
needs
force
the
relaxation
of
some
of
the
portability
guidelines
nonportable
features
of
the
source
text
are
prominently
indicated
Observing
the
Chapter
7
guidelines
requires
definition
and
standardization
of
project
or
organization
specific
numeric
types
to
be
used
in
place
of
the
potentially
nonportable
predefined
numeric
types
Your
decisions
on
standardization
issues
should
be
incorporated
in
a
project
or
organization
coding
standards
document
With
coding
standards
in
place
you
need
to
ensure
adherence
to
them
Gaining
the
wholehearted
commitment
of
your
programming
staff
to
use
the
standards
is
critical
Given
this
commitment
and
the
example
of
high
quality
Ada
being
produced
by
your
programmers
it
will
be
far
easier
to
conduct
effective
formal
code
reviews
that
check
compliance
to
project
standards
Some
general
issues
concerning
the
management
of
Ada
projects
are
discussed
by
Hefley
et
al
1992
To
Contracting
Agencies
And
Standards
Organizations
Many
of
the
guidelines
presented
here
are
specific
enough
to
be
adopted
as
corporate
or
project
programming
standards
Others
require
a
managerial
decision
on
a
particular
instantiation
before
they
can
be
used
as
standards
In
such
cases
a
sample
instantiation
is
presented
and
used
throughout
the
examples
Such
instantiations
should
be
recognized
as
weaker
recommendations
than
the
guidelines
themselves
In
some
cases
where
the
examples
are
extracted
from
a
published
work
the
author
s
style
is
used
unchanged
Other
guidelines
presented
in
this
book
are
intentionally
phrased
in
terms
of
design
choices
to
consider
These
guidelines
cannot
be
instantiated
as
hard
and
fast
rules
that
a
project
must
follow
For
example
you
should
not
interpret
Guidelines
6
1
1
and
6
1
2
to
mean
that
a
project
is
forbidden
to
use
tasks
Rather
these
guidelines
are
intended
to
help
the
designer
make
the
tradeoffs
between
using
protected
objects
and
tasks
thus
leading
the
designer
to
make
a
more
informed
choice
between
these
features
The
guidelines
in
this
document
are
not
intended
to
stand
alone
as
a
standard
In
some
cases
it
is
not
clear
that
a
guideline
could
be
enforced
because
it
is
only
intended
to
make
the
engineer
aware
of
tradeoffs
In
other
cases
a
choice
still
remains
about
a
guideline
such
as
how
many
spaces
to
use
for
each
level
of
indentation
When
a
guideline
is
too
general
to
show
an
example
the
instantiation
section
of
each
guideline
contains
more
specific
guidelines
These
instantiations
can
be
considered
a
standard
and
are
more
likely
to
be
enforceable
Any
organization
that
attempts
to
extract
standards
from
this
document
needs
to
evaluate
the
complete
context
Each
guideline
works
best
when
related
guidelines
are
practiced
In
isolation
a
guideline
may
have
little
or
no
benefit

Introduction
The
physical
layout
of
source
text
on
the
page
or
screen
has
a
strong
effect
on
its
readability
This
chapter
contains
source
code
presentation
guidelines
intended
to
make
the
code
more
readable
In
addition
to
the
general
purpose
guidelines
specific
recommendations
are
made
in
the
instantiation
sections
If
you
disagree
with
the
specific
recommendations
you
may
want
to
adopt
your
own
set
of
conventions
that
still
follow
the
general
purpose
guidelines
Above
all
be
consistent
across
your
entire
project
An
entirely
consistent
layout
is
hard
to
achieve
or
check
manually
Therefore
you
may
prefer
to
automate
layout
with
a
tool
for
parameterized
code
formatting
or
incorporate
the
guidelines
into
an
automatic
coding
template
Some
of
the
guidelines
and
specific
recommendations
presented
in
this
chapter
cannot
be
enforced
by
a
formatting
tool
because
they
are
based
on
the
semantics
not
the
syntax
of
the
Ada
code
More
details
are
given
in

Code
Formatting
The
code
formatting
of
Ada
source
code
affects
how
the
code
looks
not
what
the
code
does
Topics
included
here
are
horizontal
spacing
indentation
alignment
pagination
and
line
length
The
most
important
guideline
is
to
be
consistent
throughout
the
compilation
unit
as
well
as
the
project
Horizontal
Spacing
guideline
Use
consistent
spacing
around
delimiters
Use
the
same
spacing
as
you
would
in
regular
prose
instantiation
Specifically
leave
at
least
one
blank
space
in
the
following
places
as
shown
in
the
examples
throughout
this
book
More
spaces
may
be
required
for
the
vertical
alignment
recommended
in
subsequent
guidelines
Before
and
after
the
following
delimiters
and
binary
operators
source
lang
text
source
Outside
of
the
quotes
for
string
and
character
literals
except
where
prohibited
Outside
but
not
inside
parentheses
After
commas
and
semicolons
Do
not
leave
any
blank
spaces
in
the
following
places
even
if
this
conflicts
with
the
above
recommendations
After
the
plus
and
minus
signs
when
used
as
unary
operators
After
a
function
call
Inside
of
label
delimiters
Before
and
after
the
exponentiation
operator
apostrophe
and
period
Between
multiple
consecutive
opening
or
closing
parentheses
Before
commas
and
semicolons
When
superfluous
parentheses
are
omitted
because
of
operator
precedence
rules
spaces
may
optionally
be
removed
around
the
highest

operators
in
that

source
rationale
It
is
a
good
idea
to
use
white
space
around
delimiters
and
operators
because
they
are
typically
short
sequences
one
or
two
characters
that
can
easily
get
lost
among
the
longer
keywords
and
identifiers
Putting
white
space
around
them
makes
them
stand
out
Consistency
in
spacing
also
helps
make
the
source
code
easier
to
scan
visually
However
many
of
the
delimiters
commas
semicolons
parentheses
etc
are
familiar
as
normal
punctuation
marks
It
is
distracting
to
see
them
spaced
differently
in
a
computer
program
than
in
normal
text
Therefore
use
the
same
spacing
as
in
text
no
spaces
before
commas
and
semicolons
no
spaces
inside
parentheses
etc
exceptions
The
one
notable
exception
is
the
colon
In
Ada
it
is
useful
to
use
the
colon
as
a
tabulator
or
a
column
separator
see
Guideline
2

4
In
this
context
it
makes
sense
to
put
spaces
before
and
after
the
colon
rather
than
only
after
it
as
in
normal
text

rationale
Indentation
improves
the
readability
of
the
code
because
it
gives
you
a
visual
indicator
of
the
program
structure
The
levels
of
nesting
are
clearly
identified
by
indentation
and
the
first
and
last
keywords
in
a
construct
can
be
matched
visually
While
there
is
much
discussion
on
the
number
of
spaces
to
indent
the
reason
for
indentation
is
code
clarity
The
fact
that
the
code
is
indented
consistently
is
more
important
than
the
number
of
spaces
used
for
indentation
Additionally
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
1
1
4
states
that
the
layout
shown
in
the
examples
and
syntax
rules
in
the
manual
is
the
recommended
code
layout
to
be
used
for
Ada
programs
The
syntax
rules
describing
structured
constructs
are
presented
in
a
form
that
corresponds
to
the
recommended
paragraphing
Different
lines
are
used
for
parts
of
a
syntax
rule
if
the
corresponding
parts
of
the
construct
described
by
the
rule
are
intended
to
be
on
different
lines
It
is
recommended
that
all
indentation
be
by
multiples
of
a
basic
step
of
indentation
the
number
of
spaces
for
the
basic
step
is
not
defined
It
is
important
to
indent
continuation
lines
differently
from
nested
control
structures
to
make
them
visually
distinct
This
prevents
them
from
obscuring
the
structure
of
the
code
as
you
scan
it
Listing
context
clauses
on
individual
lines
allows
easier
maintenance
changing
a
context
clause
is
less
error
prone
Indenting
with
spaces
is
more
portable
than
indenting
with
tabs
because
tab
characters
are
displayed
differently
by
different
terminals
and
printers
exceptions
If
you
are
using
a
variable
width
font
tabs
will
align
better
than
spaces
However
depending
on
your
tab
setting
lines
of
successive
indentation
may
leave
you
with
a
very
short
line
length

rationale
Alignment
makes
it
easier
to
see
the
position
of
the
operators
and
therefore
puts
visual
emphasis
on
what
the
code
is
doing
The
use
of
lines
and
spacing
on
long
expressions
can
emphasize
terms
precedence
of
operators
and
other
semantics
It
can
also
leave
room
for
highlighting
comments
within
an
expression
exceptions
If
vertical
alignment
of
operators
forces
a
statement
to
be
broken
over
two
lines
especially
if
the
break
is
at
an
inappropriate
spot
it
may
be
preferable
to
relax
the
alignment
guideline
automation
notes
The
last
example
above
shows
a
kind
of
semantic
alignment
that
is
not
typically
enforced
or
even
preserved
by
automatic
code
formatters
If
you
break
expressions
into
semantic
parts
and
put
each
on
a
separate
line
beware
of
using
a
code
formatter
later
It
is
likely
to
move
the
entire
expression
to
a
single
line
and
accumulate
all
the
comments
at
the
end
However
there
are
some
formatters
that
are
intelligent
enough
to
leave
a
line
break
intact
when
the
line
contains
a
comment
A
good
formatter
will
recognize
that
the
last
example
above
does
not
violate
the
guidelines
and
would
therefore
preserve
it
as
written

For

not

follow
these

Align

Align
the

When
trailing
comments
are
used
align

When
the

overflows
a

break
the

The
preferred

Many

initial

comments
These

are
redundant
and
can
become
inconsistent

Aligning
the
declarations
themselves
in
tabular
fashion
see
the
examples
above
provides
identical
information
to
both
compiler
and
reader
enforces
at
most
one
declaration
per
line
and
eases
maintenance
by
providing
space
for
initializations
and
necessary
comments
A
tabular
layout
enhances
readability
thus
preventing
names
from

in
a
mass
of

This

Most
of
the

An
automatic

will
not
be
able
to
do
this
and
will
likely
move
the
enumeration
literals
to

Various

for

The
second
example
above
aligns
all
of
the
subprogram

and
parameter
names
in
a
program
This
has
the
disadvantage
of
occupying
an
unnecessary
line
where
subprogram

are
short
and
looking
awkward
if
there
is
only
one

The
third
example
is
a
format
commonly
used
to
reduce
the
amount
of
editing
required
when
parameter
lines
are
added
deleted
or

The
parentheses
do
not
have

the

exceptions
When
an
operator
function

two

more
formal

of
the
same
type
it
is
more
readable
to

Introduction
This
chapter
recommends
ways
of
using
Ada
features
to
make
reading
and
understanding
code
easier
There
are
many
myths
about
comments
and
readability
The
responsibility
for
true
readability
rests
more
with
naming
and
code
structure
than
with
comments
Having
as
many
comment
lines
as
code
lines
does
not
imply
readability
it
more
likely
indicates
the
writer
does
not
understand
what
is
important
to
communicate
Spelling
Spelling
conventions
in
source
code
include
rules
for
capitalization
and
use
of
underscores
numbers
and
abbreviations
If
you
follow
these
conventions
consistently
the
resulting
code
is
clearer
and
more
readable
Use
of
Underscores
guideline
Use
underscores
to
separate
words
in
a
compound
name
example
source
lang

Miles

Value
source
rationale
When
an
identifier
consists
of
more
than
one
word
it
is
much
easier
to
read
if
the
words
are
separated
by
underscores
Indeed
there
is
precedent
in
English
in
which
compound
words
are
separated
by
a
hyphen
or
a
space
In
addition
to
promoting
readability
of
the
code
if
underscores
are
used
in
names
a
code
formatter
has
more
control
over
altering
capitalization
See
Guideline

Numbers
guideline
Represent
numbers
in
a
consistent
fashion
Represent
literals
in
a
radix
appropriate
to
the
problem
Use
underscores
to
separate
digits
the
same
way
commas
or
periods
or
spaces
for
nondecimal
bases
would
be
used
in
normal
text
When
using
scientific
notation
make
the
E
consistently
either
uppercase
or
lowercase
In
an
alternate
base
represent
the
alphabetic
characters
in
either
all
uppercase
or
all
lowercase
instantiation
Decimal
and
octal
numbers
are
grouped
by
threes
beginning
on
the
left
side
of
the
radix
point
and
by
fives
beginning
on
the
right
side
of
the
radix
point
The
E
is
always
capitalized
in
scientific
notation
Use
uppercase
for
the
alphabetic
characters
representing
digits
in
bases
above

Hexadecimal
numbers
are
grouped
by
fours
beginning
on
either

rationale
Consistent
use

aids

Underscores
serve
to
group
portions
of
numbers
into
familiar
patterns
Consistency
with
common
use
in
everyday
contexts
is
a
large
part
of
readability
notes
If
a

is
represented
in
a
base
in
which
it
has
a
terminating

than
a
repeating
representation
as
3

does
in
the
example
above
it
may
have
increased
accuracy
upon
conversion
to
the
machine
base
This
is
wrong
for
named
numbers
as
in
this
example
they
must
be
calculated
exactly
Capitalization
guideline
Make
reserved
words
and
other
elements
of
the
program
visually
distinct
from
each
other
instantiation
Use
lowercase
for
all
reserved
words
when
used
as
reserved
words
Use
mixed
case
for
all
other
identifiers
a
capital
letter
beginning
every
word
separated
by
underscores
Use
uppercase
for
abbreviations
and
acronyms

rationale
Visually
distinguishing
reserved
words
allows
you
to
focus
on
program
structure
alone
if
desired
and
also
aids
scanning
for
particular
identifiers
The
instantiation
chosen
here
is
meant
to
be
more
readable
for
the
experienced
Ada
programmer
who
does
not
need
reserved
words
to
leap
off
the
page
Beginners
to
any
language
often
find
that
reserved
words
should
be
emphasized
to
help
them
find
the
control
structures
more
easily
Because
of
this
instructors
in
the
classroom
and
books
introducing
the
Ada
language
may
want
to
consider
an
alternative
instantiation
The
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
chose
bold
lowercase
for
all
reserved
words
automation

Ada
names
are

Therefore
the
names

max

code
code
MAX

and

A
good

formatter
should
be
able
to
automatically
convert
from
one
style
to
another
as
long
as
the
words
are
delimited

As
recommended
in

abbreviations
should
be
project
wide
An
automated
tool
should
allow
a
project
to
specify
those
abbreviations
and
format
them
accordingly
Abbreviations
guideline
Do
not
use
an
abbreviation
of
a
long
word
as
an
identifier
where
a
shorter
synonym
exists
Use
a
consistent
abbreviation
strategy
Do
not
use
ambiguous
abbreviations
To
justify
its
use
an
abbreviation
must
save
many
characters
over
the
full
word
Use
abbreviations
that
are
well
accepted
in
the
application
domain
Maintain
a
list
of
accepted
abbreviations
and
use
only
abbreviations
on
that
list
example
Use
source
lang
ada
Time
Of
Receipt
source
rather
than
source
lang
ada
Recd
Time
or
R
Time
source
But
in
an
application
that
commonly
deals
with
message
formats
that
meet
military
standards
code
DOD
STD
MSG
FMT
code
is
an
acceptable
abbreviation
for
source
lang
ada
Department
Of
Defense
Standard
Message
Format
source
rationale
Many
abbreviations
are
ambiguous
or
unintelligible
unless
taken
in
context
As
an
example
Temp
could
indicate
either
temporary
or
temperature
For
this
reason
you
should
choose
abbreviations
carefully
when
you
use
them
The
rationale
in
Guideline
8
1
2
provides
a
more
thorough
discussion
of
how
context
should
influence
the
use
of
abbreviations
Because
very
long
variable
names
can
obscure
the
structure
of
the
program
especially
in
deeply
nested
indented
control
structures
it
is
a
good
idea
to
try
to
keep
identifiers
short
and
meaningful
Use
short
unabbreviated
names
whenever
possible
If
there
is
no
short
word
that
will
serve
as
an
identifier
then
a
well
known
unambiguous
abbreviation
is
the
next
best
choice
especially
if
it
comes
from
a
list
of
standard
abbreviations
used
throughout
the
project
You
can
establish
an
abbreviated
format
for
a
fully
qualified
name
using
the
renames
clause
This
capability
is
useful
when
a
very
long
fully
qualified
name
would
otherwise
occur
many
times
in
a
localized
section
of
code
see
Guideline

A
list
of
accepted
abbreviations
for
a
project
provides
a
standard
context
for
using
each
abbreviation
Naming
Conventions
Choose
names
that
clarify
the
object
s
or
entity
s
intended
use
Ada
allows
identifiers
to
be
any
length
as
long
as
the
identifier
fits
on
a
line
with
all
characters
being
significant
including
underscores
Identifiers
are
the
names
used
for
variables
constants
program
units
and
other
entities
within
a
program
Names
guideline
Choose
names
that
are
as
self
documenting
as
possible
Use
a
short
synonym
instead
of
an
abbreviation
see
Guideline
3
1
4
Use
names
given
by
the
application
but
do
not
use
obscure
jargon
Avoid
using
the
same
name
to
declare
different
kinds
of
identifiers
example
In
a
tree
walker
using
the
name
code
Left
code
instead
of
code
Left
Branch
code
is
sufficient
to
convey
the
full
meaning
given
the
context
However
use
code
Time
Of
Day
code
instead
of
code
TOD
code
Mathematical
formulas
are
often
given
using
single
letter
names
for
variables
Continue
this
convention
for
mathematical
equations
where
they
would
recall
the
formula
for
example

With
the
use
of
child
packages
a
poor
choice
of
package
subunit
and
identifier
names
can
lead
to
a
visibility
clash
with
subunits
See
the
Rationale
1995

for
a
sample
of
the
resulting
rather
obscure
code
rationale
A
program
that
follows
these
guidelines
can
be
more
easily
comprehended
Self
documenting
names
require
fewer
explanatory
comments
Empirical
studies
have
shown
that
you
can
further
improve
comprehension
if
your
variable
names
are
not
excessively
long
Schneiderman

The
context
and
application
can
help
greatly
The
unit
of
measure
for
numeric
entities
can
be
a
source
of
subtype
names
You
should
try
not
to
use
the
same
name
as
an
identifier
for
different
declarations
such
as
an
object
and
a
child
package
Overusing
an
identifier
in
seemingly
different
name
spaces
can
in
fact
lead
to
visibility
clashes
if
the
enclosing
program
units
are
intended
to
work
together

avoid

abstractions
Without

suffixes
you
would
need
three
different

to
describe
each
of
the
concepts
succinctly
named

This
recommendation
only
applies
to
certain
visible

Private

to
resolve
the
ambiguity
introduced
by
the

Rosen

rationale
You
want
to
use
a
naming
scheme
that
is
consistent
and
readable
and
conveys
the
intent
of
the
abstraction
Ideally
the
naming
scheme
should
be
uniform
in
how
it
handles
the
different
ways
in
which
tagged
types
are
used
to
create
classes
If
the
naming
convention
is
too
rigid
however
you
will
write
code
fragments
that
appear
stilted
from
a
readability
point
of
view
By
using
a
similar
naming
convention
for
type
extension
through

and
through

you

readable
declarations
of

and

notes
A
naming
convention
for
classes
draws
a
hard
line
between
object
oriented
abstractions
and
other
kinds
of
abstractions
Given
that
engineers
have
been
defining
abstract
data
types
in
Ada
83
Ada
Reference
Manual
1983
for
over
10
years
you
may
not
want
to
change
the
naming
convention
just
for
the
sake
of
using
type
extension
with
a
type
You
must
consider
how
important
it
is
to
call
out
uses
of
inheritance
in
the
overall
use
of
abstractions
in
your
program
If
you
prefer
to
emphasize
abstraction
in
general
over
the
mechanism
used
to
implement
the
abstraction
i
e
inheritance
type
extension
and
polymorphism
you
may
not
want
to
impose
such
a
stringent
naming
convention
You
do
not
hamper
quality
by
favoring
a
smoother
transition
in
naming
conventions
from
abstractions
developed
without
inheritance
to
those
developed
with
inheritance
If
you
choose
a
naming
convention
that
highlights
the
use
of
object
oriented
features
and
later
decide
to
change
the
declaration
to
one
that
does
not
use
an
object
oriented
feature
the
change
may
be
expensive
You
must
naturally
change
all
occurrences
of
the
names
and
must
be
careful
not
to
introduce
errors
as
you
update
the
names
If
you
choose
a
naming
convention
that
prohibits
the
use
of
suffixes
or
prefixes
to
characterize
the
declaration
you
lose
the
opportunity
to
convey
the
intended
usage
of
the
declared
item
Program

Names
guideline
Use
action
verbs
for

Use

for
Boolean

Use
nouns
for
non

Give

Generally
these
are
noun

Give

Consider

rationale
Using
these
naming
conventions
creates
understandable
code
that
reads
much
like
natural
language
When
verbs
are
used
for
actions
such
as
subprograms
and
nouns
are
used
for
objects
such
as
the
data
that
the
subprogram
manipulates
code
is
easier
to
read
and
understand
This
models
a
medium
of
communication
already
familiar
to
a
reader
Where
the
pieces
of
a
program
model
a
real
life
situation
using
these
conventions
reduces
the
number
of
translation
steps
involved
in
reading
and
understanding
the
program
In
a
sense
your
choice
of
names
reflects
the
level
of
abstraction
from
computer
hardware
toward
application
requirements

notes
There
are
some
conflicting
conventions
in
current
use
for
task
entries
Some
programmers
and
designers
advocate
naming
task
entries
with
the
same
conventions
used
for
subprograms
to
blur
the
fact
that
a
task
is
involved
Their
reasoning
is
that
if
the
task
is
reimplemented
as
a
package
or
vice
versa
the
names
need
not
change
Others
prefer
to
make
the
fact
of
a
task
entry
as
explicit
as
possible
to
ensure
that
the
existence
of
a
task
with
its
presumed
overhead
is
recognizable

rationale
Using
identifiers
instead
of
literals
makes
the
purpose
of
expressions
clear
reducing
the
need
for
comments
Constant
declarations
consisting
of
expressions
of
numeric
literals
are
safer
because
they
do
not
need
to
be
computed
by
hand
They
are
also
more
enlightening
than
a
single
numeric
literal
because
there
is
more
opportunity
for
embedding
explanatory
names
Clarity
of
constant
declarations
can
be
improved
further
by
using
other
related
constants
in
static
expressions
defining
new
constants
This
is
not
less
efficient
because
static
expressions
of
named
numbers
are
computed
at
compile
time
A
constant
has
a
type
A
named
number
can
only
be
a
universal
type
universal
integer
or
universal
real
Strong
typing
is
enforced
for
constants
but
not
for
named
numbers
or
literals
Named
numbers
allow
compilers
to
generate
more
efficient
code
than
for
constants
and
to
perform
more
complete
error
checking
at
compile
time
If
the
literal
contains
a
large
number
of
digits
as
Pi
in
the
example
above
the
use
of
an
identifier
reduces
keystroke
errors
If
keystroke
errors
occur
they
are
easier
to
locate
either
by
inspection
or
at
compile
time
Independence
of
literals
means
that
the
few
literals
that
are
used
do
not
depend
on
one
another
and
that
any
relationship
between
constant
or
named
values
is
shown
in
the
static
expressions
Linear
independence
of
literal
values
gives
the
property
that
if
one
literal
value
changes
all
of
the
named
numbers
of
values
dependent
on
that
literal
are
automatically
changed
See
Guideline
4

for
additional
guidelines
on
choosing
a
parameterless
function
versus
a
constant
notes
There
are
situations
where
a
literal
is
a
better
choice
than
a
name
For
this
to
be
the
case
the
following
conditions
have
to
be
fulfilled
The
literal
has
to
be
self
explanatory
in
the
respective
context
such
that
replacing
the
literal
by
a
symbolic
value
would
not
improve
the
readability
The
value
is
either
unchangeable
or
only
occurs
at
one
single
place
in
the
code
such
that
replacing
the
literal
by
a
symbolic
value
would
not
improve
the
maintainability
For
example
the
literals
in
the
following
well
known
relationship
are
both
self
explanatory
and
unchangeable

As
a
second

self
explanatory
in
a
binary

context
And
since
the

also
unchangeably
related
with
the
algorithm
it
also
does
not
matter
if
the
literal
occurs
at
more

place
in
the
code
for
example
due
to

rationale
Naming

suggests
the

commentary
misleading
Commentary
should
be
reserved
for
expressing
needed
information
that
cannot
be
expressed
in
code
and
highlighting
cases
where
there
are
overriding
reasons
to
violate
one
of
the
guidelines
If
possible
source
text
should
use
self
explanatory
names
for
objects
and
program
units
and
it
should
use
simple
understandable
program
structures
so
that
little
additional
commentary
is
needed
The
extra
effort
in
selecting
and
entering
appropriate
names
and
the
extra
thought
needed
to
design
clean
and
understandable
program
structures
are
fully
justified
Use
comments
to
state
the
intent
of
the
code
Comments
that
provide
an
overview
of
the
code
help
the
maintenance
programmer
see
the
forest
for
the
trees
The
code
itself
is
the
detailed
how
and
should
not
be
paraphrased
in
the
comments
Comments
should
be
minimized
They
should
provide
needed
information
that
cannot
be
expressed
in
the
Ada
language
emphasize
the
structure
of
code
and
draw
attention
to
deliberate
and
necessary
violations
of
the
guidelines
Comments
are
present
either
to
draw
attention
to
the
real
issue
being
exemplified
or
to
compensate
for
incompleteness
in
the
sample
program
Maintenance
programmers
need
to
know
the
causal
interaction
of
noncontiguous
pieces
of
code
to
get
a
global
more
or
less
complete
sense
of
the
program
They
typically
acquire
this
kind
of
information
from
mental
simulation
of
parts
of
the
code
Comments
should
be
sufficient
enough
to
support
this
process
Soloway
et
al
1986
This
section
presents
general
guidelines
about
how
to
write
good
comments
It
then
defines
several
different
classes
of
comments
with
guidelines
for
the
use
of
each
The
classes
are
file
headers
program
unit
specification
headers
program

statement
comments

comments
General
Comments
guideline
Make
the
code
as
clear
as
possible
to
reduce
the
need
for
comments
Never
repeat
information
in
a
comment
that
is
readily
available
in
the
code
Where
a
comment
is
required
make
it
concise
and
complete
Use
proper
grammar
and
spelling
in
comments
Make
comments
visually
distinct
from
the
code
Structure
comments
in
header
so
that
information
can
be
automatically
extracted
by
a
tool
rationale
The
structure
and
function
of
well
written
code
is
clear
without
comments
Obscured
or
badly
structured
code
is
hard
to
understand
maintain
or
reuse
regardless
of
comments
Bad
code
should
be
improved
not
explained
Reading
the
code
itself
is
the
only
way
to
be
absolutely
positive
about
what
the
code
does
therefore
the
code
should
be
made
as
readable
as
possible
Using
comments
to
duplicate
information
in
the
code
is
a
bad
idea
for
several
reasons
First
it
is
unnecessary
work
that
decreases
productivity
Second
it
is
very
difficult
to
correctly
maintain
the
duplication
as
the
code
is
modified
When
changes
are
made
to
existing
code
it
is
compiled
and
tested
to
make
sure
that
it
is
once
again
correct
However
there
is
no
automatic
mechanism
to
make
sure
that
the
comments
are
correctly
updated
to
reflect
the
changes
Very
often
the
duplicate
information
in
a
comment
becomes
obsolete
at
the
first
code
change
and
remains
so
through
the
life
of
the
software
Third
when
comments
about
an
entire
system
are
written
from
the
limited
point
of
view
of
the
author
of
a
single
subsystem
the
comments
are
often
incorrect
from
the
start
Comments
are
necessary
to
reveal
information
difficult
or
impossible
to
obtain
from
the
code
Subsequent
chapters
of
this
book
contain
examples
of
such
comments
Completely
and
concisely
present
the
required
information
The
purpose
of
comments
is
to
help
readers
understand
the
code
Misspelled
ungrammatical
ambiguous
or
incomplete
comments
defeat
this
purpose
If
a
comment
is
worth
adding
it
is
worth
adding
correctly
in
order
to
increase
its
usefulness
Making
comments
visually
distinct
from
the
code
by
indenting
them
grouping
them
together
into
headers
or
highlighting
them
with
dashed
lines
is
useful
because
it
makes
the
code
easier
to
read
Subsequent
chapters
of
this
book
elaborate
on
this
point
automation
notes
The
guideline
about
storing
redundant
information
in
comments
applies
only
to
manually
generated
comments
There
are
tools
that
automatically
maintain
information
about
the
code
e
g
calling
units
called
units
cross
reference
information
revision
histories
etc
storing
it
in
comments
in
the
same
file
as
the
code
Other
tools
read
comments
but
do
not
update
them
using
the
information
from
the
comments
to
automatically
generate
detailed
design
documents
and
other
reports
The
use
of
such
tools
is
encouraged
and
may
require
that
you
structure
your
header
comments
so
they
can
be
automatically
extracted
and
or
updated
Beware
that
tools
that
modify
the
comments
in
a
file
are
only
useful
if
they
are
executed
frequently
enough
Automatically
generated
obsolete
information
is
even
more
dangerous
than
manually
generated
obsolete
information
because
it
is
more
trusted
by
the
reader
Revision
histories
are
maintained
much
more
accurately
and
completely
by
configuration
management
tools
With
no
tool
support
it
is
very
common
for
an
engineer
to
make
a
change
and
forget
to
update
the
revision
history
If
your
configuration
management
tool
is
capable
of
maintaining
revision
histories
as
comments
in
the
source
file
then
take
advantage
of
that
capability
regardless
of
any
compromise
you
might
have
to
make
about
the
format
or
location
of
the
revision
history
It
is
better
to
have
a
complete
revision
history
appended
to
the
end
of
the
file
than
to
have
a
partial
one
formatted
nicely

Ownership
information
should
be

in

if
you

to
be
sure
to

to
the
software
Furthermore
for
high
visibility
it
should
be
the
first

in
the
file
Responsibility
and
revision
history
information
should
be
present
in
each
file
for
the
sake
of
future
maintainers
this
is
the
header
information
most
trusted
by
maintainers
because
it
accumulates
It
does
not
evolve
There
is
no
need
to
ever
go
back
and
modify
the
author
s
name
or
the
revision
history
of
a
file
As
the
code
evolves
the
revision
history
should
be
updated
to
reflect
each
change
At
worst
it
will
be
incomplete
it
should
rarely
be
wrong
Also
the
number
and
frequency
of
changes
and
the
number
of
different
people
who
made
the
changes
over
the
history
of
a
unit
can
be
good
indicators
of
the
integrity
of
the
implementation
with
respect
to
the
design
Information
about
how
to
find
the
original
author
should
be
included
in
the
file
header
in
addition
to
the
author
s
name
to
make
it
easier
for
maintainers
to
find
the
author
in
case
questions
arise
However
detailed
information
like
phone
numbers
mail
stops
office
numbers
and
computer
account
user
names
are
too
volatile
to
be
very
useful
It
is
better
to
record
the
department
for
which
the
author
was
working
when
the
code
was
written
This
information
is
still
useful
if
the
author
moves
offices
changes
departments
or
even
leaves
the
company
because
the
department
is
likely
to
retain
responsibility
for
the
original
version
of
the
code
notes
With
modern
configuration

systems
explicitly
capturing

rationale
The
purpose
of
a
header
comment
on
the
specification
of
a
program
unit
is
to
help
the
user
understand
how
to
use
the
program
unit
From
reading
the
program
unit
specification
and
header
a
user
should
know
everything
necessary
to
use
the
unit
It
should
not
be
necessary
to
read
the
body
of
the
program
unit
Therefore
there
should
be
a
header
comment
on
each
program
unit
specification
and
each
header
should
contain
all
usage
information
not
expressed
in
the
specification
itself
Such
information
includes
the
units
effects
on
each
other
and
on
shared
resources
exceptions
raised
and
time
space
characteristics
None
of
this
information
can
be
determined
from
the
Ada
specification
of
the
program
unit
When
you
duplicate
information
in
the
header
that
can
be
readily
obtained
from
the
specification
the
information
tends
to
become
incorrect
during
maintenance
For
example
do
not
make
a
point
of
listing
all
parameter
names
modes
or
subtypes
when
describing
a
procedure
This
information
is
already
available
from
the
procedure
specification
Similarly
do
not
list
all
subprograms
of
a
package
in
the
header
unless
this
is
necessary
to
make
some
important
statement
about
the
subprograms
Do
not
include
information
in
the
header
that
the
user
of
the
program
unit
does
not
need
In
particular
do
not
include
information
about
how
a
program
unit
performs
its
function
or
why
a
particular
algorithm
was
used
This
information
should
be
hidden
in
the
body
of
the
program
unit
to
preserve
the
abstraction
defined
by
the
unit
If
the
user
knows
such
details
and
makes
decisions
based
on
that
information
the
code
may
suffer
when
that
information
is
later
changed
When
describing
the
purpose
of
the
unit
avoid
referring
to
other
parts
of
the
enclosing
software
system
It
is
better
to
say
this
unit
does
than
to
say
this
unit
is
called
by
Xyz
to
do
The
unit
should
be
written
in
such
a
way
that
it
does
not
know
or
care
which
unit
is
calling
it
This
makes
the
unit
much
more
general
purpose
and
reusable
In
addition
information
about
other
units
is
likely
to
become
obsolete
and
incorrect
during
maintenance
Include
information
about
the
performance
time
and
space
characteristics
of
the
unit
Much
of
this
information
is
not
present
in
the
Ada
specification
but
it
is
required
by
the
user
To
integrate
the
unit
into
a
system
the
user
needs
to
understand
the
resource
usage
CPU
memory
etc
of
the
unit
It
is
especially
important
to
note
that
when
a
subprogram
call
causes
activation
of
a
task
hidden
in
a
package
body
the
task
may
continue
to
consume
resources
after
the
subroutine
ends
notes
Some
projects
have
deferred
most
of
the
commentary
to
the
end
rather
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
program
unit
Their
rationale
is
that
program
units
are
written
once
and
read
many
times
and
that
long
header
comments
make
the
start
of
the
specification
difficult
to
find
exceptions
Where
a
group
of
program
units
are
closely
related
or
simple
to
understand
it
is
acceptable
to
use
a
single
header
for
the
entire
group
of
program
units
For
example
it
makes
sense
to
use
a
single
header
to
describe
the
behavior
of
Max
and
Min
functions
Sin
Cos
and
Tan
functions
or
a
group
of
functions
to
query
related
attributes
of
an
object
encapsulated
in
a
package
This
is
especially
true
when
each
function
in
the
set
is
capable
of
raising
the
same
exceptions

rationale
The
purpose
of
a
header
comment
on
the
body
of
a
program
unit
is
to
help
the
maintainer
of
the
program
unit
to
understand
the
implementation
of
the
unit
including
tradeoffs
among
different
techniques
Be
sure
to
document
all
decisions
made
during
implementation
to
prevent
the
maintainer
from
making
the
same
mistakes
you
made
One
of
the
most
valuable
comments
to
a
maintainer
is
a
clear
description
of
why
a
change
being
considered
will
not
work
The
header
is
also
a
good
place
to
record
portability
concerns
The
maintainer
may
have
to
port
the
software
to
a
different
environment
and
will
benefit
from
a
list
of
nonportable
features
Furthermore
the
act
of
collecting
and
recording
portability
issues
focuses
attention
on
these
issues
and
may
result
in
more
portable
code
from
the
start
Summarize
complex
algorithms
in
the
header
if
the
code
is
difficult
to
read
or
understand
without
such
a
summary
but
do
not
merely
paraphrase
the
code
Such
duplication
is
unnecessary
and
hard
to
maintain
Similarly
do
not
repeat
the
information
from
the
header
of
the
program
unit
specification
notes
It
is
often
the
case
that
a
program
unit
is
self
explanatory
so
that
it
does
not
require
a
body
header
to
explain
how
it
is
implemented
or
why
In
such
a
case
omit
the
header
entirely
as
in
the
case
with
Position
Of
above
Be
sure
however
that
the
header
you
omit
truly
contains
no
information
For
example
consider
the
difference
between
the
two

sections

involving

These
data
structures
are
used
to
store
the

The
overall
organization
is
a
sorted

of
ranks

a

each

Arc

rationale
It
is
very
useful
to
add
comments
explaining
the
purpose
structure
and
semantics
of
the
data
structures
Many
maintainers
look
at
the
data
structures
first
when
trying
to
understand
the
implementation
of
a
unit
Understanding
the
data
that
can
be
stored
along
with
the
relationships
between
the
different
data
items
and
the
flow
of
data
through
the
unit
is
an
important
first
step
in
understanding
the
details
of
the
unit
In
the
first
example
above
the
names
Current
Column
and
Current
Row
are
relatively
self
explanatory
The
name
Desired
Column
is
also
well
chosen
but
it
leaves
the
reader
wondering
what
the
relationship
is
between
the
current
column
and
the
desired
column
The
comment
explains
the
reason
for
having
both
Another
advantage
of
commenting
on
the
data
declarations
is
that
the
single
set
of
comments
on
a
declaration
can
replace
multiple
sets
of
comments
that
might
otherwise
be
needed
at
various
places
in
the
code
where
the
data
is
manipulated
In
the
first
example
above
the
comment
briefly
expands
on
the
meaning
of
current
and
marked
It
states
that
the
current
position
is
the
location
of
the
cursor
the
current
position
is
in
the
current
buffer
and
the
marked
position
was
marked
by
the
user
This
comment
along
with
the
mnemonic
names
of
the
variables
greatly
reduces
the
need
for
comments
at
individual
statements
throughout
the
code
It
is
important
to
document
the
full
meaning
of
exceptions
and
under
what
conditions
they
can
be
raised
as
shown
in
the
second
example
above
especially
when
the
exceptions
are
declared
in
a
package
specification
The
reader
has
no
other
way
to
find
out
the
exact
meaning
of
the
exception
without
reading
the
code
in
the
package
body
Grouping
all
the
exceptions
together
as
shown
in
the
second
example
can
provide
the
reader
with
the
effect
of
a
glossary
of
special
conditions
This
is
useful
when
many
different
subprograms
in
the
package
can
raise
the
same
exceptions
For
a
package
in
which
each
exception
can
be
raised
by
only
one
subprogram
it
may
be
better
to
group
related
subprograms
and
exceptions
together
When
commenting
exceptions
it
is
better
to
describe
the
exception
s
meaning
in
general
terms
than
to
list
all
the
subprograms
that
can
cause
the
exception
to
be
raised
such
a
list
is
harder
to
maintain
When
a
new
routine
is
added
it
is
likely
that
these
lists
will
not
be
updated
Also
this
information
is
already
present
in
the
comments
describing
the
subprograms
where
all
exceptions
that
can
be
raised
by
the
subprogram
should
be
listed
Lists
of
exceptions
by
subprogram
are
more
useful
and
easier
to
maintain
than
lists
of
subprograms
by
exception
In
the
third
example
the
names
of
the
record
fields
are
short
and
mnemonic
but
they
are
not
completely
self
explanatory
This
is
often
the
case
with
complex
data
structures
involving
access
types
There
is
no
way
to
choose
the
record
and
field
names
so
that
they
completely
explain
the
overall
organization
of
the
records
and
pointers
into
a
nested
set
of
sorted
lists
The
comments
shown
are
useful
in
this
case
Without
them
the
reader
would
not
know
which
lists
are
sorted
which
lists
are
doubly
linked
or
why
The
comments
express
the
intent
of
the
author
with
respect
to
this
complex
data
structure
The
maintainer
still
has
to
read
the
code
if
he
wants
to
be
sure
that
the
double
links
are
all
properly
maintained
Keeping
this
in
mind
when
reading
the
code
makes
it
much
easier
for
the
maintainer
to
find
a
bug
where
one
pointer
is
updated
and
the
opposite
one
is
not
See

the

making

call
to

rationale
The
improvements
shown
in
the
example
are
not
improvements
merely
by
reducing
the
total
number
of
comments
they
are
improvements
by
reducing
the
number
of
useless
comments
Comments
that
paraphrase
or
explain
obvious
aspects
of
the
code
have
no
value
They
are
a
waste
of
effort
for
the
author
to
write
and
the
maintainer
to
update
Therefore
they
often
end
up
becoming
incorrect
Such
comments
also
clutter
the
code
hiding
the
few
important
comments
Comments
describing
what
goes
on
inside
another
unit
violate
the
principle
of
information
hiding
The
details
about
Convert
To
Integer
deleted
above
are
irrelevant
to
the
calling
unit
and
they
are
better
left
hidden
in
case
the
algorithm
ever
changes
Examples
explaining
what
goes
on
elsewhere
in
the
code
are
very
difficult
to
maintain
and
almost
always
become
incorrect
at
the
first
code
modification
The
advantage
of
making
comments
visually
distinct
from
the
code
is
that
it
makes
the
code
easier
to
scan
and
the
few
important
comments
stand
out
better
Highlighting
unusual
or
special
code
features
indicates
that
they
are
intentional
This
assists
maintainers
by
focusing
attention
on
code
sections
that
are
likely
to
cause
problems
during
maintenance
or
when
porting
the
program
to
another
implementation
Comments
should
be
used
to
document
code
that

dependent
environment

or
tricky
in
any
way
They
notify
the
reader
that
something
unusual
was

there
for
a
reason
A
beneficial
comment
would
be
one
explaining
a
work

for
a

If
you

the
software
engineering
sense

Information
included
in
the
comments
should
state
why
you
used
that
particular
construct
Also
include
documentation
on
the
failed
attempts
for
example
using
a
higher
level
structure
This
kind
of
comment
is
useful
to
maintainers
for
historical
purposes
You
show
the
reader
that
a
significant
amount
of
thought
went
into
the
choice
of
a
construct
Finally
comments
should
be
used
to
explain
what
is
not
present
in
the
code
as
well
as
what
is
present
If
you
make
a
conscious
decision
to
not
perform
some
action
like
deallocating
a
data
structure
with
which
you
appear
to
be
finished
be
sure
to
add
a
comment
explaining
why
not
Otherwise
a
maintainer
may
notice
the
apparent
omission
and
correct
it
later
thus
introducing
an
error

a

of
what
kind
of
documentation
you
should
provide
regarding

Further
improvements
can
be
made
on
the
above
example
by
declaring
the
variables
Count
and
Sum
in
a
local
block
so
that
their
scope
is
limited
and
their
initializations
occur
near
their

the

by
moving

into
a

Marker
comments
are
not
necessary
with

because
the
syntax
of
these

allows
them
to
be
named
with
the

repeated
at

Using
these

is
better
than
using
marker
comments
because
the

verifies
that
the

match

Using
Types
Strong
typing
promotes
reliability
in
software
The
type
definition
of
an
object
defines
all
legal
values
and
operations
and
allows
the
compiler
to
check
for
and
identify
potential
errors
during
compilation
In
addition
the
rules
of
type
allow
the
compiler
to
generate
code
to
check
for
violations
of
type
constraints
at
execution
time
Using
these
Ada
compiler
s
features
facilitates
earlier
and
more
complete
error
detection
than
that
which
is
available
with
less
strongly
typed
languages

rationale
Eliminating
meaningless
values
from
the
legal
range
improves
the
compiler
s
ability
to
detect
errors
when
an
object
is
set
to
an
invalid
value
This
also
improves
program
readability
In
addition
it
forces
you
to
carefully
think
about
each
use
of
objects
declared
to
be
of
the
subtype
Different
implementations
provide
different
sets
of
values
for
most
of
the
predefined
types
A
reader
cannot
determine
the
intended
range
from
the
predefined
names
This
situation
is
aggravated
when
the
predefined
names
are
overloaded
The
names
of
an
object
and
its
subtype
can
clarify
their
intended
use
and
document
low
level
design
decisions
The
example
above
documents
a
design
decision
to
restrict
the
software
to
devices
whose
physical
parameters
are
derived
from
the
characteristics
of
punch
cards
This
information
is
easy
to
find
for
any
later
changes
thus
enhancing
program
maintainability
You
can
rename
a
type
by
declaring
a
subtype
without
a
constraint
Ada

You
cannot
overload
a
subtype
name
overloading
only
applies
to
callable
entities
Enumeration
literals
are
treated
as
parameterless
functions
and
so
are
included
in
this
rule
Types
can
have
highly
constrained
sets
of
values
without
eliminating
useful
values
Usage
as
described
in

eliminates
many
flag
variables
and
type
conversions
within
executable
statements
This
renders
the
program
more
readable
while
allowing
the
compiler
to
enforce
strong
typing
constraints
notes
Subtype
declarations
do
not
define
new
types
only
constraints
for
existing
types
Any
deviation
from
this
guideline
detracts
from
the
advantages
of
the
strong
typing
facilities
of
the
Ada
language
exceptions
There
are
cases
where
you
do
not
have
a
particular
dependence
on
any
range
of
numeric
values
Such
situations
occur
for
example
with
array
indices
e
g
a
list
whose
size
is
not
fixed
by
any
particular
semantics

Types
guideline
Use
enumeration
types
instead
of
numeric

Only
if
absolutely
necessary
use
representation
clauses
to
match

rationale
Enumerations
are
more
robust
than
numeric
codes
they
leave
less
potential
for
errors
resulting
from
incorrect
interpretation
and
from
additions
to
and
deletions
from
the
set
of
values
during
maintenance
Numeric
codes
are
holdovers
from
languages
that
have
no
user
defined
types
In
addition
Ada
provides
a
number
of
attributes
Pos
Val
Succ
Pred
Image
and
Value
for
enumeration
types
that
when
used
are
more
reliable
than
user
written
operations
on
encodings
A
numeric
code
may
at
first
seem
appropriate
to
match
external
values
Instead
these
situations
call
for
a
representation
clause
on
the
enumeration
type
The
representation
clause
documents
the
encoding
If
the
program
is
properly
structured
to
isolate
and
encapsulate
hardware
dependencies

the
numeric
code
ends
up
in
an
interface
package
where
it
can
be
easily
found
and
replaced
if
the
requirements
change
In
general
avoid
using
representation
clauses
for
enumeration
types
When
there
is
no
obvious
ordering
of
the
enumeration
literals
an
enumeration
representation
can
create
portability

if
the
enumeration
type
must
be
reordered
to
accommodate
a
change
in

platform
Summary

Do
not

given
by
the

but
do
not
use
obscure

Avoid
using
the
same

to
declare
different
kinds
of

Use
singular
general
nouns
as

Consider
using
suffixes
for

Give
packages
names
that
imply
a
higher
level
of
organization
than
subprograms
Generally
these
are
noun
phrases
that
describe
the

Introduction
Proper
structure
improves
program
clarity
This
is
analogous
to
readability
on
lower
levels
and
facilitates
the
use
of
the
readability
guidelines
Chapter
3
The
various
program
structuring
facilities
provided
by
Ada
were
designed
to
enhance
overall
clarity
of
design
These
guidelines
show
how
to
use
these
facilities
for
their
intended
purposes
The
concept
of
child
packages
supports
the
concept
of
subsystem
where
a
subsystem
is
represented
in
Ada
as
a
hierarchy
of
library
units
In
general
a
large
system
should
be
structured
as
a
series
of
subsystems
Subsystems
should
be
used
to
represent
logically
related
library
units
which
together
implement
a
single
high
level
abstraction
or
framework
Abstraction
and
encapsulation
are
supported
by
the
package
concept
and
by
private
types
Related
data
and
subprograms
can
be
grouped
together
and
seen
by
a
higher
level
as
a
single
entity
Information
hiding
is
enforced
via
strong
typing
and
by
the
separation
of
package
and
subprogram
specifications
from
their
bodies
Exceptions
and
tasks
are
additional
Ada
language
elements
that
impact
program
structure
High
Level
Structure
Well
structured
programs
are
easily
understood
enhanced
and
maintained
Poorly
structured
programs
are
frequently
restructured
during
maintenance
just
to
make
the
job
easier
Many
of
the
guidelines
listed
below
are
often
given
as
general
program
design
guidelines
Separate
Compilation
Capabilities
guideline
Place
the
specification
of
each
library
unit
package
in
a
separate
file
from
its
body
Avoid
defining
library
unit
subprograms
that
are
not
intended
to
be
used
as
main
programs
If
such
subprograms
are
defined
then
create
an
explicit
specification
in
a
separate
file
for
each
library
unit
subprogram
Minimize
the
use
of
subunits
In
preference
to
subunits
use
child
library
units
to
structure
a
subsystem
into
manageable
units
Place
each
subunit
in
a
separate
file
Use
a
consistent
file
naming
convention
In
preference
to
nesting
in
a
package
body
use
a
private
child
and
with
it
to
the
parent
body
Use
private
child
unit
specifications
for
data
and
subprograms
that
are
required
by
other
child
units
that
extend
a
parent
unit
s
abstraction
or
services
example
The
file
names
below
illustrate
one
possible
file
organization
and
associated
consistent
naming
convention
The
library
unit
name
uses
the
adb
suffix
for
the
body
The
suffix
ads
indicates
the
specification
and
any
files
containing
subunits
use
names
constructed
by
separating
the
body
name
from
the
subunit
name
with
an
underscore

Depending
on
what
characters
your
file
system
allows
you
to
use
in
file
names
you
could
show
the
distinction
between
parent
and
subunit
name
more
clearly
in
the
file
name
If
your
file
system
allows
the
character
for
example
you
could
separate
the
body
name
from
the
subunit
name
with
a
text

Some
operating
systems
are
case
sensitive
although
Ada
itself
is
not
a
case
sensitive
language
For
example
you
could
choose
a
convention
of
all
lowercase
file
names
rationale
The
main
reason
for
the
emphasis
on
separate
files
in
this
guideline
is
to
minimize
the
amount
of
recompilation
required
after
each
change
Typically
during
software
development
bodies
of
units
are
updated
far
more
often
than
specifications
If
the
body
and
specification
reside
in
the
same
file
then
the
specification
will
be
compiled
each
time
the
body
is
compiled
even
though
the
specification
has
not
changed
Because
the
specification
defines
the
interface
between
the
unit
and
all
of
its
users
this
recompilation
of
the
specification
typically
makes
recompilation
of
all
users
necessary
in
order
to
verify
compliance
with
the
specification
If
the
specifications
and
bodies
of
the
users
also
reside
together
then
any
users
of
these
units
will
also
have
to
be
recompiled
and
so
on
The
ripple
effect
can
force
a
huge
number
of
compilations
that
could
have
been
avoided
severely
slowing
the
development
and
test
phase
of
a
project
This
is
why
you
should
place
specifications
of
all
library
units
nonnested
units
in
separate
files
from
their
bodies
Library
unit
subprograms
should
be
minimized
The
only
real
use
for
library
unit
subprograms
is
as
the
main
subprogram
In
almost
all
other
cases
it
is
better
to
embed
the
subprogram
into
a
package
This
provides
a
place
the
package
body
to
localize
data
needed
by
the
subprogram
Moreover
it
cuts
down
on
the
number
of
separate
modules
in
the
system
In
general
you
should
use
a
separate
specification
for
any
library
subprogram
that
is
mentioned
in
a
with
clause
This
makes
the
with
ing
unit
dependent
on
the
library
subprogram
specification
not
its
body
You
should
minimize
the
use
of
subunits
because
they
create
maintenance
problems
Declarations
appearing
in
the
parent
body
are
visible
in
the
subunit
increasing
the
amount
of
data
global
to
the
subunit
and
thus
increasing
the
potential
ripple
effect
of
changes
Subunits
hinder
reuse
because
they
provide
an
incentive
to
put
otherwise
reusable
code
in
the
subunit
directly
rather
than
in
a
common
routine
called
from
multiple
subprograms
With
the
availability
of
child
library
units
in
Ada
95
you
can
avoid
most
uses
of
subunits
For
example
instead
of
using
a
subunit
for
a
large
nested
body
you
should
try
to
encapsulate
this
code
in
a
child
library
unit
and
add
the
necessary
context
clauses
You
can
modify
the
body
of
the
child
unit
without
having
to
recompile
any
of
the
other
units
in
a
subsystem
An
additional
benefit
of
using
multiple
separate
files
is
that
it
allows
different
implementors
to
modify
different
parts
of
the
system
at
the
same
time
with
conventional
editors
which
do
not
allow
multiple
concurrent
updates
to
a
single
file
Finally
keeping
bodies
and
specifications
separate
makes
it
possible
to
have
multiple
bodies
for
the
same
specification
or
multiple
specifications
for
the
same
body
Although
Ada
requires
that
there
be
exactly
one
specification
per
body
in
a
system
at
any
given
time
it
can
still
be
useful
to
maintain
multiple
bodies
or
multiple
specifications
for
use
in
different
builds
of
a
system
For
example
a
single
specification
may
have
multiple
bodies
each
of
which
implements
the
same
functionality
with
a
different
tradeoff
of
time
versus
space
efficiency
or
for
machine
dependent
code
there
may
be
one
body
for
each
target
machine
Maintaining
multiple
package
specifications
can
also
be
useful
during
development
and
test
You
may
develop
one
specification
for
delivery
to
your
customer
and
another
for
unit
testing
The
first
one
would
export
only
those
subprograms
intended
to
be
called
from
outside
of
the
package
during
normal
operation
of
the
system
The
second
one
would
export
all
subprograms
of
the
package
so
that
each
of
them
could
be
independently
tested
A
consistent
file
naming
convention
is
recommended
to
make
it
easier
to
manage
the
large
number
of
files
that
may
result
from
following
this
guideline
In
implementing
the
abstraction
defined
in
a
package
specification
you
often
need
to
write
supporting
subprograms
that
manipulate
the
internal
representation
of
the
data
These
subprograms
should
not
be
exported
on
the
interface
You
have
a
choice
of
whether
to
place
them
in
the
package
body
of
the
parent
program
or
in
a
child
package
named
in
a
context
clause
of
the
parent
package
body
When
you
place
them
in
the
parent
package
body
you
make
them
inaccessible
to
all
clients
of
the
parent
including
extensions
of
the
parent
declared
in
child
packages
If
these
subprograms
are
needed
to
implement
extensions
of
the
parent
abstraction
you
would
be
forced
to
modify
both
the
parent
specification
and
the
body
because
you
would
have
to
declare
the
extensions
within
the
parent
specification
This
technique
would
then
force
recompilation
of
the
entire
package
specification
and
body
as
well
as
all
its
clients
Alternatively
you
can
implement
the
supporting
subprograms
in
a
private
child
package
Because
the
parent
unit
s
specification
is
not
modified
neither
it
nor
its
clients
need
to
be
recompiled
The
data
and
subprograms
that
might
have
declared
in
the
parent
unit
body
must
now
be
declared
in
the
private
child
unit
s
specification
to
make
them
visible
to
both
the
parent
unit
body
and
to
any
child
units
that
extend
the
parent
unit
s
services
or
abstractions
See
also
Guidelines

and

This
use
of
private
child
units
will
generally
minimize
recompilations
within
the
unit
family
and
among
its
clients
In
declaring
the
child
package
private
you
achieve
a
similar
effect
to
declaring
it
in
the
parent
package
body
to
the
extent
that
clients
of
the
parent
cannot
name
the
private
child
in
a
context
clause
You
gain
flexibility
because
now
you
can
extend
the
parent
abstraction
using
child
packages
without
having
to
recompile
the
parent
specification
or
its
body
assuming
that
you
do
not
otherwise
modify
the
parent
or
its
body
This
added
flexibility
will
usually
compensate
for
the
increased
dependency
between
units
in
this
case
the
additional
context
clause
on
the
parent
body
and
other
child
package
bodies
that
names
the
private
child
package
of
supporting
subprograms
Configuration
Pragmas
guideline
When
possible
express
configuration
pragmas
through
compiler
options
or
other
means
that
do
not
require
modifications
to
the
source
code
When
configuration
pragmas
must
be
placed
in
source
code
consider
isolating
them
to
one
compilation
unit
per
partition
if
specified
the
main
subprogram
for
the
partition
is
recommended
rationale
Configuration
pragmas
are
generally
used
to
select
a
partition
wide
or
system
wide
option
Usually
they
reflect
either
high
level
software
architecture
decisions
e
g
pragma
Task
Dispatching
Policy
or
the
use
of
the
software
in
a
particular
application
domain
e
g
safety
critical
software
If
a
configuration
pragma
is
embedded
within
a
software
component
and
that
component
is
reused
in
a
different
context
where
the
pragma
is
no
longer
appropriate
then
it
may
cause
problems
in
the
new
application
Such
problems
can
include
the
rejection
by
the
compilation
system
of
otherwise
legal
source
code
or
unexpected
behavior
at
run
time
These
problems
can
be
significant
given
the
wide
scope
of
a
configuration
pragma
In
addition
maintenance
of
the
original
system
may
require
that
some
of
these
system
wide
decisions
be
changed
If
the
configuration
pragmas
are
scattered
throughout
the
software
it
may
be
difficult
to
locate
the
lines
that
need
to
change
As
a
result
it
is
recommended
that
all
configuration
pragmas
be
kept
in
a
single
compilation
unit
if
possible
to
make
them
easy
to
locate
and
modify
as
needed
If
this
compilation
unit
is
unlikely
to
be
reused
e
g
a
main
subprogram
then
the
likelihood
of
conflicts
with
future
reusers
is
reduced
Finally
if
these
system
wide
decisions
are
indicated
without
embedding
them
in
the
code
at
all
such
as
through
a
compiler
option
then
the
problems
described
above
are
even
less
likely
to
occur
exceptions
Certain
pragmas
e
g
pragma
Suppress
can
be
used
in
several
forms
including
as
a
configuration
pragma
This
guideline
does
not
apply
to
such
pragmas
when
they
are
not
used
as
a
configuration
pragma
Subprograms
guideline
Use
subprograms
to
enhance
abstraction
Restrict
each
subprogram
to
the
performance
of
a
single
action
example
Your
program
is
required
to
draw
a
menu
of
user
options
as
part
of
a
menu
driven
user
interface
package
Because
the
contents
of
the
menu
can
vary
depending
on
the
user
state
the
proper
way
to
do
this
is
to
write
a
subprogram
to
draw
the
menu
This
way
the
output
subprogram
has
one
purpose
and
the
way
to
determine
the

It

Functions
guideline
Use
a
function
when
the
subprogram
s
primary
purpose
is
to
provide
a
single
value
Minimize
the
side
effect
of
a
function
Consider
using
a
parameterless
function
when
the
value
does
not
need
to
be
static
Use
a
parameterless
function
instead
of
a
constant
if
the
value
should
be
inherited
by
types
derived
from
the
type
Use
a
parameterless
function
if
the
value
itself
is
subject
to
change
example
Although
reading
a
character
from
a
file
will
change
what
character
is
read
next
this
is
accepted
as
a
minor
side
effect
compared
to
the
primary
purpose
of
the
following
function
source
lang
ada
function
Next
Character
return
Character
is
separate
source
However
the
use
of
a
function
like
this
could
lead
to
a
subtle
problem
Any
time
the
order
of
evaluation
is
undefined
the
order
of
the
values
returned
by
the
function
will
effectively
be
undefined
In
this
example
the
order
of
the
characters
placed
in
Word
and
the
order
that
the
following
two

Of
course
if
the
order
is
unimportant
as
in
a
random
number
generator
then
the
order
of

is
unimportant
The
following

the
use

example
could
have
been
written
using
constants

rationale
A
side
effect
is
a
change
to
any
variable
that
is
not
local
to
the
subprogram
This
includes
changes
to
variables
by
other
subprograms
and
entries
during
calls
from
the
function
if
the
changes
persist
after
the
function
returns
Side
effects
are
discouraged
because
they
are
difficult
to
understand
and
maintain
Additionally
the
Ada
language
does
not
define
the
order
in
which
functions
are
evaluated
when
they
occur
in
expressions
or
as
actual
parameters
to
subprograms
Therefore
a
program
that
depends
on
the
order
in
which
side
effects
of
functions
occur
is
erroneous
Avoid
using
side
effects
anywhere
Packages

Packages

the
principal

in
Ada
They
are
intended
to
be
used
as
direct
support
for

information
hiding
and
modularization
For
example
they
are
useful
for
encapsulating
machine

as
an
aid
to

A
single
specification
can
have
multiple
bodies
isolating
implementation
specific
information
so
other
parts
of
the

Encapsulating

rationale
The
user
can
create
more
precise
packages
with
less
cluttered
interfaces
using
child
library
packages
to
extend
the
interfaces
as
needed
The
parent
contains
only
the
relevant
functionality
The
parent
provides
a
general

while
the
child
units
provide
more
complete
programming
interfaces
tailored
to
that
aspect
of
an
abstraction
that
they
are
extending
or
defining
Child
packages
build
on
the
modular
strength
of
Ada
where
the
distinct
specification
and

decouple
the

to
a

the

Rationale

Child
packages
provide
the
added
capability
of
being
able
to
extend
a
parent
package
without
recompiling
the
parent
or
the
parent
s
clients
Child
packages
allow
you
to
write
logically
distinct
packages
that
share
a
private
type
The
visibility
rules
give
the
private
part
of
the
child
specification
and
the
body
of
the
child
visibility
into
the
private
part
of
the
parent
Thus
you
can
avoid
creating
a
monolithic
package
for
the
sake
of
developing
abstractions
that
share
a
private
type
and
need
to
know
its
representation
The
private
representation
is
not
available
to
clients
of
the
package
so
the
abstraction
in
the
package
and
its
children
is
maintained
Using
private
child
packages
for
local
declarations
enables
you
to
have
available
the
support
declarations
you
need
when
implementing
both
the
parent
package
and
extensions
to
the
parent
package
You
enhance
the
maintainability
of
your
program
by
using
a
common
set
of
support
declarations
data
representations
data
manipulation
subprograms
You
can
modify
the
internal
representation
and
the
implementation
of
the
support
subprograms
without
modifying
or
recompiling
the
rest
of
your
subsystem
because
these
support
subprograms
are
implemented
in
the

of
the

Consider
restructuring
a
system
to
move
two
highly
related
units
into
the
same
package
or
package
hierarchy
or
to
move
relatively
independent
units
into
separate
packages
example
As
a
bad
example
a
package
named
Project
Definitions
is
obviously
a
catch
all
for
a
particular
project
and
is
likely
to
be
a
jumbled
mess
It
probably
has
this
form
to
permit
project
members
to
incorporate
a
single
with
clause
into
their
software
Better
examples
are
packages
called
Display
Format
Definitions
containing
all
the
types
and
constants
needed
by
some
specific
display
in
a
specific
format
and
Cartridge
Tape
Handler
containing
all
the
types
constants
and
subprograms
that
provide
an
interface
to
a
special
purpose
device
rationale
The
degree
to
which
the
entities
in
a
package
are
related
has
a
direct
impact
on
the
ease
of
understanding
packages
and
programs
made
up
of
packages
There
are
different
criteria
for
grouping
and
some
criteria
are
less
effective
than
others
Grouping
the
class
of
data
or
activity
e
g
initialization
modules
or
grouping
data
or
activities
based
on
their
timing
characteristics
is
less
effective
than
grouping
based
on
function
or
need
to
communicate
through
data
Charette
1986
The
correct
structuring
of
a
system
can
make
a
tremendous
difference
in
the
maintainability
of
a
system
Although
it
may
seem
painful
at
the
time
it
is
important
to
restructure
if
the
initial
structuring
is
not
quite
right

on
heterogeneous
data
notes
Traditional
subroutine
libraries
often
group
functionally
unrelated
subroutines
Even
such
libraries
should
be
broken
into
a
collection
of
packages
each
containing
a
logically
cohesive
set
of
subprograms
Data
Coupling
guideline
Avoid
declaring
variables
in
package
specifications
example
This
is
part
of
a
compiler
Both
the
package
handling
error
messages
and
the
package
containing
the
code
generator
need
to
know
the
current
line
number
Rather
than
storing
this
in
a
shared
variable
of
type
Natural
the
information
is
stored
in
a
package
that
hides
the
details
of
how
such
information
is
represented
and
makes
it
available

access

rationale
Strongly
coupled
program
units
can
be
difficult
to
debug
and
very
difficult
to
maintain
By
protecting
shared
data
with
access
functions
the
coupling
is
lessened
This
prevents
dependence
on
the
data
structure
and
access
to
the
data
can
be
controlled
notes
The
most
prevalent
objection
to
this
guideline
usually
involves
performance
penalties
When
a
variable
is
moved
to
the
package
body
subprograms
to
access
the
variable
must
be
provided
and
the
overhead
involved
during
each
call
to
those
subprograms
is
introduced

rationale
For

the
specification
give
careful
consideration
to
whether
it
could
be
moved
to
a
child
package
or
to
the
parent
package
body
The
fewer
the
extraneous
details
the
more
understandable
the
program
package
or

It
is
important
to
maintainers
to
know
exactly
what
a
package
interface
is
so
that
they
can
understand
the
effects
of
changes
Interfaces
to
a
subprogram
extend
beyond
the
parameters
Any
modification
of
global
data
from
within
a
package
or
subprogram
is
an
undocumented
interface
to
the
outside
as
well
Minimize
the
context
clauses
on
a
specification
by
moving
unnecessary
clauses
to
the
body
This
technique
makes
the
reader
s
job
easier
localizes
the
recompilation
required
when
library
units
change
and
helps
prevent
a
ripple
effect
during
modifications

Subprograms
with
large
numbers
of
parameters
often
indicate
poor
design
decisions
e
g
the
functional
boundaries
of
the
subprogram
are
inappropriate
or
parameters
are
structured
poorly
Conversely
subprograms
with
no
parameters
are
likely
to
be
accessing
global
data
Objects
visible
within
package
specifications
can
be
modified
by
any
unit
that
has
visibility
to
them
The
object
cannot
be
protected
or
represented
abstractly
by
its
enclosing
package
Objects
that
must
persist
should
be
declared
in
package
bodies
Objects
whose
value
depends
on
program
units
external
to
their
enclosing
package
are
probably
either
in
the
wrong
package
or
are
better
accessed
by
a
subprogram
specified
in
the
package
specification
Child
library
units
can
provide
distinct
views
of
the
hierarchical
library
The
engineer
can
provide
a
different
view
for
the
client
than
for
the
implementor
Rationale
1995

By
creating
private
child
packages
the
engineer
can
provide
facilities
that
are
only
available
inside
the
subsystem
rooted
at
the
parent
library
unit
The
declarations
inside
a
private
child
package
specification
are
not
exported
outside
the
subsystem
Thus
the
engineer
can
declare
utilities
needed
to
implement
an
abstraction
in
a
private
child
package
e
g
debugging
utilities
Cohen
et
al
1993
and
be
certain
that
users
of
the
abstraction
i
e
the
clients
cannot
access
these
utilities
Different
clients
may
have
different
needs
for
essentially
the
same
resource
Instead
of
having
multiple
versions
of
the
resources
consider
having
child
units
that
export
different
views
for
different
purposes
Designing
an
interface
based
strictly
on
predicting
what
clients
might
need
can
produce
a
bloated
and
inappropriate
interface
What
then
happens
is
that
clients
try
to
live
with
the
interface
and
work
around
the
inappropriate
interfaces
repeating
code
that
logically
should
be
part
of
the
shared
abstraction
See
Guideline
8

1
for
a
discussion
of
interfaces
from
the
reusability
perspective
notes
In
some
cases
subroutine
libraries
look
like
large
monolithic
packages
In
such
cases
it
may
be
beneficial
to
break
these
up
into
smaller
packages
grouping
them
according
to
category
e
g
trigonometric
functions
Nested
Packages
guideline
Use
child
packages
rather
than
nested
packages
to
present
different
views
of
the
same
abstraction
Nest
package
specifications
within
another
package
specification
only
for
grouping
operations
or
hiding
common
implementation
details
example
Annex
A
of
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
gives
an
example
of
package
specification
nesting
The
specification
of
the
generic
package
Generic
Bounded
Length
is
nested
inside
the
specification
of
package
Ada
Strings
Bounded
The
nested
package
is
a
generic
grouping
closely
related
operations
rationale
Grouping
package
specifications
into
an
encompassing
package
emphasizes
a
relationship
of
commonality
among
those
packages
It
also
allows
them
to
share
common
implementation
details
resulting
from
the
relationship
Nesting
packages
allows
you
to
organize
the
name
space
of
the
package
in
contrast
to
the
semantic
effect
of
nesting
inside
of
subprograms
or
task
bodies
An
abstraction
occasionally
needs
to
present
different
views
to
different
classes
of
users
Building
one
view
upon
another
as
an
additional
abstraction
does
not
always
suffice
because
the
functionality
of
the
operations
presented
by
the
views
may
be
only
partially
disjointed
Nesting
specifications
groups
the
facilities
of
the
various
views
yet
associates
them
with
the
abstraction
they
present
Abusive
mixing
of
the
views
by
another
unit
would
be
easy
to
detect
due
to
the
multiple
use
clauses
or
an
incongruous
mix
of
qualified
names

the
rationale
discussed
in

Restricting
Visibility
guideline
Consider
using

Restrict
the

of

as
much
as
possible
by
nesting
them

if
you
cannot
use

units
inside

Minimize
the

within
which

example
This
program
illustrates
the
use
of
child
library
units
to
restrict
visibility
The
procedure
Rational
Numbers
Reduce
is
nested
inside
the
body
of
Rational
Numbers
to
restrict
its
visibility
to
the
implementation
of
this
abstraction
Rather
than
make
the
text

rationale
Restricting
visibility
of
a
program
unit
ensures
that
the
program
unit
is
not
called
from
some
part
of
the
system
other
than
that
which
was
intended
This
is
done
by
nesting
it
inside
the
only
unit
that
uses
it
by
hiding
it
inside
a
package
body
rather
than
declaring
it
in
the
package
specification
or
by
declaring
it
as
a
private
child
unit
This
avoids
errors
and
eases
the
job
of
maintainers
by
guaranteeing
that
a
local
change
in
that
unit
will
not
have
an
unforeseen
global
effect
Restricting
visibility
of
a
library
unit
by
using
with
clauses
on
subunits
rather
than
on
the
entire
parent
unit
is
useful
in
the
same
way
In
the
example
above
it
is
clear
that
the
package
Text
IO
is
used
only
by
the
Listing
Facilities
package
of
the
compiler
Nesting
inside
subprograms
and
tasks
is
discouraged
because
it
leads
to
unreusable
components
These
components
are
essentially
unreusable
because
they
make
undesirable
up
level
references
into
the
defining
context
Unless
you
truly
want
to
ensure
that
the
program
unit
is
not
called
from
some
unintended
part
of
the
system
you
should
minimize
this
form
of
nesting

for

One
way
to
minimize
the
coverage

is
to
use

only
with

Consider
making

rationale
The
decision
whether
to
declare
a
task
in
the
specification
or
body
of
an
enclosing
package
is
not
a
simple
one
There
are
good
arguments
for
both
Hiding
a
task
specification
in
a
package
body
and
exporting
via
subprograms
only
required
entries
reduces
the
amount
of
extraneous
information
in
the
package
specification
It
allows
your
subprograms
to
enforce
any
order
of
entry
calls
necessary
to
the
proper
operation
of
the
tasks
It
also
allows
you
to
impose
defensive
task
communication
practices
see
Guideline
6
2
2
and
proper
use
of
conditional
and
timed
entry
calls
Finally
it
allows
the
grouping
of
entries
into
sets
for
export
to
different
classes
of
users
e
g
producers
versus
consumers
or
the
concealment
of
entries
that
should
not
be
made
public
at
all
e
g
initialization
completion
signals
Where
performance
is
an
issue
and
there
are
no
ordering
rules
to
enforce
the
entries
can
be
renamed
as
subprograms
to
avoid
the
overhead
of
an
extra
procedure
call
An
argument
which
can
be
viewed
as
an
advantage
or
disadvantage
is
that
hiding
the
task
specification
in
a
package
body
hides
the
fact
of
a
tasking
implementation
from
the
user
If
the
application
is
such
that
a
change
to
or
from
a
tasking
implementation
or
a
reorganization
of
services
among
tasks
need
not
concern
users
of
the
package
then
this
is
an
advantage
However
if
the
package
user
must
know
about
the
tasking
implementation
to
reason
about
global
tasking
behavior
then
it
is
better
not
to
hide
the
task
completely
Either
move
it
to
the
package
specification
or
add
comments
stating
that
there
is
a
tasking
implementation
describing
when
a
call
may
block
etc
Otherwise
it
is
the
package
implementor
s
responsibility
to
ensure
that
users
of
the
package
do
not
have
to
concern
themselves
with
behaviors
such
as
deadlock
starvation
and
race
conditions
Finally
keep
in
mind
that
hiding
tasks
behind
a
procedural
interface
prevents
the
usage
of
conditional
and
timed
entry
calls
and
entry
families
unless
you
add
parameters
and
extra
code
to
the
procedures
to
make
it
possible
for
callers
to
direct
the
procedures
to
use
these
capabilities
Exceptions
This
section
addresses
the
issue
of
exceptions
in
the
context
of
program
structures
It
discusses
how
exceptions
should
be
used
as
part
of
the
interface
to
a
unit
including
what
exceptions
to
declare
and
raise
and
under
what

rationale
Exceptions
should
be
used
as
part
of
an
abstraction
to
indicate
error
conditions
that
the
abstraction
is
unable
to
prevent
or
correct
Because
the
abstraction
is
unable
to
correct
such
an
error
it
must
report
the
error
to
the
user
In
the
case
of
a
usage
error
e
g
attempting
to
invoke
operations
in
the
wrong
sequence
or
attempting
to
exceed
a
boundary
condition
the
user
may
be
able
to
correct
the
error
In
the
case
of
an
error
beyond
the
control
of
the
user
the
user
may
be
able
to
work
around
the
error
if
there
are
multiple
mechanisms
available
to
perform
the
desired
operation
In
other
cases
the
user
may
have
to
abandon
use
of
the
unit
dropping
into
a
degraded
mode
of
limited
functionality
In
any
case
the
user
must
be
notified
Exceptions
are
a
good
mechanism
for
reporting
such
errors
because
they
provide
an
alternate
flow
of
control
for
dealing
with
errors
This
allows
error
handling
code
to
be
kept
separate
from
the
code
for
normal
processing
When
an
exception
is
raised
the
current
operation
is
aborted
and
control
is
transferred
directly
to
the
appropriate
exception
handler
Several
of
the
guidelines
above
exist
to
maximize
the
ability
of
the
user
to
distinguish
and
correct
different
kinds
of
errors
Declaring
new
exception
names
rather
than
raising
exceptions
declared
in
other
packages
reduces
the
coupling
between
packages
and
also
makes
different
exceptions
more
distinguishable
Exporting
the
names
of
all
exceptions
that
a
unit
can
raise
rather
than
declaring
them
internally
to
the
unit
makes
it
possible
for
users
of
the
unit
to
refer
to
the
names
in
exception
handlers
Otherwise
the
user
would
be
able
to
handle
the
exception
only
with
an
others
handler
Finally
use
comments
to
document
exactly
which
of
the
exceptions
declared
in
a
package
can
be
raised
by
each
subprogram
or
task
entry
making
it
possible
for
the
user
to
know
which
exception
handlers
are
appropriate
in
each
situation
In
situations
where
there
are
errors
for
which
the
abstraction
user
can
take
no
intelligent
action
e
g
there
is
no
workaround
or
degraded
mode
it
is
better
to
export
a
single
internal
error
exception
Within
the
package
you
should
consider
distinguishing
between
the
different
internal
errors
For
instance
you
could
record
or
handle
different
kinds
of
internal
error
in
different
ways
When
you
propagate
the
error
to
the
user
however
you
should
use
a
special
internal
error
exception
indicating
that
no
user
recovery
is
possible
You
should
also
provide
relevant
information
when
you
propagate
the
error
using
the
facilities
provided
in
Ada
Exceptions
Thus
for
any
abstraction
you
effectively
provide
N
1
different
exceptions
N
different
recoverable
errors
and
one
irrecoverable
error
for
which
there
is
no
mapping
to
the
abstraction
Both
the
application
requirements
and
what
the
client
needs
wants
in
terms
of
error
information
help
you
identify
the
appropriate
exceptions
for
an
abstraction
Because
they
cause
an
immediate
transfer
of
control
exceptions
are
useful
for
reporting
unrecoverable
errors
which
prevent
an
operation
from
being
completed
but
not
for
reporting
status
or
modes
incidental
to
the
completion
of
an
operation
They
should
not
be
used
to
report
internal
errors
that
a
unit
was
able
to
correct
invisibly
to
the
user
To
provide
the
user
with
maximum
flexibility
it
is
a
good
idea
to
provide
interrogative
functions
that
the
user
can
call
to
determine
whether
an
exception
would
be
raised
if
a
subprogram
or
task
entry
were
invoked
The
function
Stack
Empty
in
the
above
example
is
such
a
function
It
indicates
whether
Underflow
would
be
raised
if
Pop
were
called
Providing
such
functions
makes
it
possible
for
the
user
to
avoid
triggering
exceptions
To
support
error
recovery
by
its
user
a
unit
should
try
to
avoid
changing
state
during
an
invocation
that
raises
an
exception
If
a
requested
operation
cannot
be
completely
and
correctly
performed
then
the
unit
should
either
detect
this
before
changing
any
internal
state
information
or
should
revert
to
the
state
at
the
time
of
the
request
For
example
after
raising
the
exception
Underflow
the
stack
package
in
the
above
example
should
remain
in
exactly
the
same
state
it
was
in
when
Pop
was
called
If
it
were
to
partially
update
its
internal
data
structures
for
managing
the
stack
then
future
Push
and
Pop
operations
would
not
perform
correctly
This
is
always
desirable
but
not
always
possible
User
defined
exceptions
should
be
used
instead
of
predefined
or
compiler
defined
exceptions
because
they
are
more
descriptive
and
more
specific
to
the
abstraction
The
predefined
exceptions
are
very
general
and
can
be
triggered
by
many
different
situations
Compiler
defined
exceptions
are
nonportable
and
have
meanings
that
are
subject
to
change
even
between
successive
releases
of
the
same
compiler
This
introduces
too
much
uncertainty
for
the
creation
of
useful
handlers
If
you
are
writing
an
abstraction
remember
that
the
user
does
not
know
about
the
units
you
use
in
your
implementation
That
is
an
effect
of
information
hiding
If
any
exception
is
raised
within
your
abstraction
you
must
catch
it
and
handle
it
The
user
is
not
able
to
provide
a
reasonable
handler
if
the
original
exception
is
allowed
to
propagate
out
of
the
body
of
your
abstraction
You
can
still
convert
the
exception
into
a
form
intelligible
to
the
user
if
your
abstraction
cannot
effectively
recover
on
its
own
Converting
an
exception
means
raising
a
user
defined
exception
in
the
handler
for
the
original
exception
This
introduces
a
meaningful
name
for
export
to
the
user
of
the
unit
Once
the
error
situation
is
couched
in
terms
of
the
application
it
can
be
handled
in
those
terms

Introduction
Concurrency
exists
as
either
apparent
concurrency
or
real
concurrency
In
a
single
processor
environment
apparent
concurrency
is
the
result
of
interleaved
execution
of
concurrent
activities
In
a
multiprocessor
environment
real
concurrency
is
the
result
of
overlapped
execution
of
concurrent
activities
Concurrent
programming
is
more
difficult
and
error
prone
than
sequential
programming
The
concurrent
programming
features
of
Ada
are
designed
to
make
it
easier
to
write
and
maintain
concurrent
programs
that
behave
consistently
and
predictably
and
avoid
such
problems
as
deadlock
and
starvation
The
language
features
themselves
cannot
guarantee
that
programs
have
these
desirable
properties
They
must
be
used
with
discipline
and
care
a
process
supported
by
the
guidelines
in
this
chapter
The
correct
usage
of
Ada
concurrency
features
results
in
reliable
reusable
and
portable
software
Protected
objects
added
in
Ada

encapsulate
and
provide
synchronized
access
to
their
private
data
Rationale

Protected
objects
help
you
manage
shared
data
without
incurring
a
performance
penalty
Tasks
model
concurrent
activities
and
use
the
rendezvous
to
synchronize
between
cooperating
concurrent
tasks
Much
of
the
synchronization
required
between
tasks
involves
data
synchronization
which
can
be
accomplished
most
efficiently
in
general
using
protected
objects
Misuse
of
language
features
results
in
software
that
is
unverifiable
and
difficult
to
reuse
or
port
For
example
using
task
priorities
or
delays
to
manage
synchronization
is
not
portable
It
is
also
important
that
a
reusable
component
not
make
assumptions
about
the
order
or
speed
of
task
execution
i
e
about
the
compiler
s
tasking
implementation
Although
concurrent
features
such
as
tasks
and
protected
objects
are
supported
by
the
core
Ada
language
care
should
be
taken
when
using
these
features
with
implementations
that
do
not
specifically
support
Annex
D
Real
Time
Systems
If
Annex
D
is
not
specifically
supported
features
required
for
real
time
applications
might
not
be
implemented
Guidelines
in
this
chapter
are
frequently
worded
consider
because
hard
and
fast
rules
cannot
apply
in
all
situations
The
specific
choice
you
make
in
a
given
situation
involves
design
tradeoffs
The
rationale
for
these
guidelines
is
intended
to
give
you
insight
into
some
of
these
tradeoffs
Concurrency
Options
Many
problems
map
naturally
to
a
concurrent
programming
solution
By
understanding
and
correctly
using
the
Ada
language
concurrency
features
you
can
produce
solutions
that
are
largely
independent
of
target
implementation
Tasks
provide
a
means
within
the
Ada
language
of
expressing
concurrent
asynchronous
threads
of
control
and
relieving
programmers
from
the
problem
of
explicitly
controlling
multiple
concurrent
activities
Protected
objects
serve
as
a
building
block
to
support
other
synchronization
paradigms

rationale
Protected
objects
are
intended
to
provide
a
lightweight
mechanism
for
mutual
exclusion
and
data
synchronization
You
should
use
a
task
only
when
you
need
to
introduce
explicitly
a
new
concurrent
thread
of

Protected
objects
offer
a
low
overhead
efficient
means
to
coordinate
access
to
shared
data
A
protected
type
declaration
is
similar
to
a
program
unit
and
consists
of
both
a
specification
and
a
body
The
data
to
be
protected
must
be
declared
in
the
specification
as
well
as
the
operations
that
can
be
used
to
manipulate
this
data
If
some
operations
are
only
allowed
conditionally
entries
must
be
provided
Ada
95
rules
require
that
entry
barriers
be
evaluated
at
the
end
of
procedure
calls
and
entry
calls
on
protected
objects
Entry
barriers
should
avoid
referring
to
global
variables
so
that
the
underlying
assumptions
of
the
state
of
the
protected
object
are
not
violated
Protected
procedures
and
entries
should
be
used
to
change
the
state
of
a
protected
object
Most
clients
of
an
abstraction
do
not
need
to
know
how
it
is
implemented
whether
it
is
a
regular
abstraction
or
a
shared
abstraction
A
protected
type
is
inherently
a
limited
type
and
you
can
use
protected
types
to
implement
a
limited
private
type
exported
by
a
package
As
pointed
out
in
Guideline

abstractions
are
best
implemented
using
private
types
possibly
derived
from
controlled
types
or
limited
private
types
providing
appropriate
operations
that
overcome
the
restrictiveness
imposed
by
the
use
of
private
types
The
Rationale
1995

describes
the
interrupt
handling
features
that
make
the
protected
procedure
the
recommended
building
block
A
protected
procedure
is
very
well
suited
to
act
as
an
interrupt
handler
for
a
number
of
reasons
they
both
typically
have
a
short
bounded
execution
time
do
not
arbitrarily
block
have
a
limited
context
and
finally
they
both
have
to
integrate
with
the
priority
model
The
nonblocking
critical
region
matches
the
needs
of
an
interrupt
handler
as
well
as
the
needs
of
non
interrupt
level
code
to
synchronize
with
an
interrupt
handler
The
entry
barrier
construct
allows
an
interrupt
handler
to
signal
a
normal
task
by
changing
the
state
of
a
component
of
the
protected
object
and
thereby
making
a
barrier
true
When
using
protected
procedures
for
interrupt
handling
you
must
ensure
that
the
ceiling
priority
of
the
handler
is
at
least
as
high
as
the
maximum
possible
priority
of
the
interrupt
to
be
handled
With
priority
ceiling
locking
the
delivery
of
an
interrupt
with
a
higher
priority
than
the
ceiling
priority
of
the
handler
will
result
in
erroneous
execution

A
global
variable
could
be
changed
by
another
task
or
even
by
a
call
of
a
protected
function
These
changes
will
not
be
acted
upon
promptly
Therefore
you
should
not
use
a
global
variable
in
an
entry
barrier
Side
effects
in
barrier
expressions
can
cause
undesirable
dependencies
Therefore
you
should
avoid
the
use
of
barrier
expressions
that
can
cause
side
effects

If
the
client
of
the
abstraction
containing
the

must
use
a

must
expose
the
protected
object
on
the

Tasks
guideline
Use

Consider

Protected

are

Multiple
tasks
that
implement
the
decomposition
of
a
large
matrix
multiplication
algorithm
are
an
example
of
an
opportunity
for
real
concurrency
in
a
multiprocessor
target
environment
In
a
single
processor
target
environment
this
approach
may
not
be
justified
due
to
the
overhead
incurred
from
context
switching
and
the
sharing
of
system
resources
A
task
that
updates
a
radar
display
every
30
milliseconds
is
an
example
of
a
cyclic
activity
supported
by
a
task
A
task
that
detects
an
over
temperature
condition
in
a
nuclear
reactor
and
performs
an
emergency
shutdown
of
the
systems
is
an
example
of
a
task
to
support
a
high
priority
activity
rationale
These
guidelines
reflect
the
intended
uses
of
tasks
They
all
revolve
around
the
fact
that
a
task
has
its
own
thread
of
control
separate
from
the
main
subprogram
or
environment
task
of
a
partition
The
conceptual
model
for
a
task
is
a
separate
program
with
its
own
virtual
processor
This
provides
the
opportunity
to
model
entities
from
the
problem
domain
in
terms
more
closely
resembling
those
entities
and
the
opportunity
to
handle
physical
devices
as
a
separate
concern
from
the
main
algorithm
of
the
application
Tasks
also
allow
naturally
concurrent
activities
that
can
be
mapped
to
multiple
processors
within
a
partition
when
available
You
should
use
tasks
for
separate
threads
of
control
When
you
synchronize
tasks
you
should
use
the
rendezvous
mechanism
only
when
you
are
trying
to
synchronize
actual
processes
e
g
specify
a
time
sensitive
ordering
relationship
or
tightly
coupled
interprocess
communication
For
most
synchronization
needs
however
you
should
use
protected
objects
see
Guideline

which
are
more
flexible
and
can
minimize
unnecessary
bottlenecks
Additionally
passive
tasks
are
probably
better
modeled
through
protected
objects
than
active
tasks
Resources
shared
between
multiple
tasks
such
as
devices
require
control
and
synchronization
because
their
operations
are
not
atomic
Drawing
a
circle
on
a
display
might
require
that
many
low
level
operations
be
performed
without
interruption
by
another
task
A
display
manager
would
ensure
that
no
other
task
accesses
the
display
until
all
these
operations
are
complete

rationale
Using
discriminants
to
parameterize
protected
objects
provides
a
low
overhead
way
of
specializing
the
protected
object
You
avoid
having
to
declare
and
call
special
subprograms
solely
for
the
purpose
of
passing
this
information
to
the
protected

Task
discriminants
provide
a
way
for
you
to
identify
or
parameterize
a
task
without
the
overhead
of
an
initial

example
you
can
use
this
discriminant
to
initialize
a
task
or
tell
it
who
it
is
from
among
an
array
of
tasks

More
importantly
you
can
associate
the
discriminant
with
specific
data
When
you
use
an
access
discriminant
you
can
bind
the
data
securely
to
the
task
because
the
access
discriminant
is
constant
and
cannot
be
detached
from
the
task

has
a
potential
danger
in
that
the

rationale
The
use
of
anonymous
tasks
and
protected
objects
of
anonymous
type
avoids
a
proliferation
of
task
and
protected
types
that
are
only
used
once
and
the
practice
communicates
to
maintainers
that
there
are
no
other
tasks
or
protected
objects
of
that
type
If
the
need
arises
later
to
have
additional
tasks
or
protected
objects
of
the
same
type
then
the
work
required
to
convert
an
anonymous
task
to
a
task
type
or
an
anonymous
protected
object
to
a
protected
type
is
minimal
The
consistent
and
logical
use
of
task
and
protected
types
when
necessary
contributes
to
understandability
Identical
tasks
can
be
declared
using
a
common
task
type
Identical
protected
objects
can
be
declared
using
a
common
protected
type
Dynamically
allocated
task
or
protected
structures
are
necessary
when
you
must
create
and
destroy
tasks
or
protected
objects
dynamically
or
when
you
must
reference
them
by
different
names
notes
Though
changing
the
task
or
protected
object
from
an
anonymous
type
to
a
declared
type
is
trivial
structural
changes
to
the
software
architecture
might
not
be
trivial
Introduction
of
multiple
tasks

of
the

might
require
the

You

when
you
need
to
allow
the

When
you
must
ensure
that
tasks
are
activated
in
a
particular
order
you
should
use
dynamically
allocated
tasks
because
the
Ada
language
does
not
define
an
activation
order
for
statically
allocated
task
objects
In
using
dynamically

you
face
the

as
with

example
For
example
let
the

have
the
following
priorities
source
lang
ada
task
T1
is
pragma

High
end
T1
task
T2

end
Server

At
some
point
in
its
execution
T1
is
blocked
Otherwise
T2
and
Server
might
never
execute
If
T1
is
blocked
it
is
possible
for
T2
to
reach
its
call
to
Server
s
entry
Operation
before
T1
Suppose
this
has
happened
and
that
T1
now
makes
its
entry
call
before
Server
has
a
chance
to
accept
T2
s
call
This
is
the
timeline
of
events
so
far
T1
blocks
T2
calls
Server
Operation
T1
unblocks
T1
calls
Server
Operation
Does
Server
accept
the
call
from
T1
or
from
T2
You
might
expect
that
due
to
its
higher
priority
T1
s
call
would
be
accepted
by
Server
before
that
of
T2
However
entry
calls
are
queued
in
first
in
first
out
FIFO
order
and
not
queued
in
order
of
priority
unless
pragma
Queueing
Policy
is
used
Therefore
the
synchronization
between
T1
and
Server
is
not
affected
by
T1
s
priority
As
a
result
the
call
from
T2
is
accepted
first
This
is
a
form
of
priority
inversion
Annex
D
can
change
the
default
policy
of
FIFO
queues
A
solution
might
be
to
provide
an
entry
for
a
High

user
and
an
entry
for
a
Medium

user
source

in
this
approach
T1
still
waits

rationale
The
pragma
Priority
allows
relative
priorities
to
be
placed
on
tasks
to
accomplish
scheduling
Precision
becomes
a
critical
issue
with
hard
deadline
scheduling
However
there
are
certain
problems
associated
with
using
priorities
that
warrant
caution
Priority
inversion
occurs
when
lower
priority
tasks
are
given
service
while
higher
priority
tasks
remain
blocked
In
the
first
example
this
occurred
because
entry
queues
are
serviced
in
FIFO
order
not
by
priority
There
is
another
situation
referred
to
as
a
race
condition
A
program
like
the
one
in
the
first
example
might
often
behave
as
expected
as
long
as
T1
calls
Server
Operation
only
when
T2
is
not
already
using
Server
Operation
or
waiting
You
cannot
rely
on
T1
always
winning
the
race
because
that
behavior
would
be
due
more
to
fate
than
to
the
programmed
priorities
Race
conditions
change
when
either
adding
code
to
an
unrelated
task
or
porting
this
code
to
a
new
target
You
should
not
rely
upon
task
priorities
to
achieve
an
exact
sequence
of
execution
or
rely
upon
them
to
achieve
mutual
exclusion
Although
the
underlying
dispatching
model
is
common
to
all
Ada
95
implementations
there
might
be
differences
in
dispatching
queuing
and
locking
policies
for
tasks
and
protected
objects
All
of
these
factors
might
lead
to
different
sequences
of
execution
If
you
need
to
ensure
a
sequence
of
execution
you
should
make
use
of
Ada
s
synchronization
mechanisms
i
e
protected
objects
or
rendezvous
notes
Work
is
being
done
to
minimize
these
problems
including
the
introduction
of
a
scheduling
algorithm
known
as
the
priority
ceiling
protocol
Goodenough
and
Sha
1988
The
priority
ceiling
protocol
reduces
the
blocking
time
that
causes
priority
inversion
to
only
one
critical
region
defined
by
the
entries
in
a
task
The
protocol
also
eliminates
deadlock
unless
a
task
recursively
tries
to
access
a
critical
region
by
giving
a
ceiling
priority
to
each
task
accessing
a
resource
that
is
as
high
as
the
priority
of
any
task
that
ever
accesses
that
resource
This
protocol
is
based
on
priority
inheritance
and
thus
deviates
from
the
standard
Ada
tasking
paradigm
which
supports
priority
ceiling
emulation
instead
of
the
priority
ceiling
blocking
that
occurs
with
priority
inheritance
Priorities
are
used
to
control
when
tasks
run
relative
to
one
another
When
both
tasks
are
not
blocked
waiting
at
an
entry
the
highest
priority
task
is
given
precedence
However
the
most
critical
tasks
in
an
application
do
not
always
have
the
highest
priority
For
example
support
tasks
or
tasks
with
small
periods
might
have
higher
priorities
because
they
need
to
run
frequently
All
production
quality
validated
Ada
95
compilers
will
probably
support
pragma
Priority
However
you
should
use
caution
unless
Annex
D
is
specifically
supported
There
is
currently
no
universal
consensus
on
how
to
apply
the
basic
principles
of
rate
monotonic
scheduling
RMS
to
the
Ada
95
concurrency
model
One
basic
principle
of
RMS
is
to
arrange
all
periodic
tasks
so
that
tasks
with
shorter
periods
have
higher
priorities
than
tasks
with
longer
periods
However
with
Ada
95
it
might
be
faster
to
raise
the
priorities
of
tasks
whose
jobs
suddenly
become
critical
than
to
wait
for
an
executive
task
to
reschedule
them
In
this
case
priority
inversion
can
be
minimized
using
a
protected
object
with
pragma
Locking
Policy
Ceiling
Locking
as
the

instead
of
a

Delay

The
phase
of

periodic
task
is
the
fraction
of
a
complete
cycle
elapsed
as
measured
from
a

In
the

rationale
There
are
two
forms
of
delay
statement
The
delay
will
cause
a
delay
for
at
least
a
specified
time
interval
The
delay
until
causes
a
delay
until
an
absolute
wake
up
time
You
should
choose
the
form
appropriate
to
your
application
The
Ada
language
definition
only
guarantees
that
the
delay
time
is
a
minimum
The
meaning
of
a
delay
or
delay
until
statement
is
that
the
task
is
not
scheduled
for
execution
before
the
interval
has
expired
In
other
words
a
task
becomes
eligible
to
resume
execution
as
soon
as
the
amount
of
time
has
passed
However
there
is
no
guarantee
of
when
or
if
it
is
scheduled
after
that
time
because
the
required
resources
for
that
task
might
not
be
available
at
the
expiration
of
the
delay
A
busy
wait
can
interfere
with
processing
by
other
tasks
It
can
consume
the
very
processor
resource
necessary
for
completion
of
the
activity
for
which
it
is
waiting
Even
a
loop
with
a
delay
can
have
the
impact
of
busy
waiting
if
the
planned
wait
is
significantly
longer
than
the
delay
interval
If
a
task
has
nothing
to
do
it
should
be
blocked
at
an
accept
or
select
statement
an
entry
call
or
an
appropriate
delay
The
expiration
time
for
a
relative
delay
is
rounded
up
to
the
nearest
clock
tick
If
you
use
the
real
time
clock
features
provided
by

clock

are
guaranteed
to
be
no
greater
than

Extensibility
and
Concurrent
Structures
guideline
Carefully
consider
the
placement
of
components
of
protected
types
within
a
tagged
type
inheritance
hierarchy
Consider
using
generics
to
provide
extensibility
of
data
types
requiring
the
restrictions
provided
by
protected
objects
rationale
Once
a
component
of
a
protected
type
is
added
to
an
inheritance
hierarchy
of
an
abstract
data
type
further
extensibility
of
that
data
type
is
impaired
When
you
constrain
the
concurrent
behavior
of
a
type
i
e
introduce
a
protected
type
component
you
lose
the
ability
to
modify
that
behavior
in
subsequent
derivations
Therefore
when
the
need
arises
for
a
version
of
an
abstract
data
type
to
impose
the
restrictions
provided
by
protected
objects
the
opportunity
for
reuse
is
maximized
by
adding
the
protected
objects
at
the
leaves
of
the
inheritance
hierarchy
The
reusability
of
common
protected
operations
e
g
mutually
exclusive
read
write
operations
can
be
maximized
by
using
generic
implementations
of
abstract
data
types
These
generic
implementations
then
provide
templates
that
can
be
instantiated
with
data
types
specific
to
individual
applications
notes
You
can
address
synchronization
within
an
inheritance
hierarchy
in
one
of
three
ways
You
can
declare
the
root
as
a
limited
tagged
type
with
a
component
that
belongs
to
a
protected
type
and
give
the
tagged
type
primitive
operations
that
work
by
invoking
the
protected
operations
of
that
component
Given
a
tagged
type
implementing
an
abstract
data
type
perhaps
resulting
from
several
extensions
you
can
declare
a
protected
type
with
a
component
belonging
to
the
tagged
type
The
body
of
each
protected
operation
would
then
invoke
the
corresponding
operation
of
the
abstract
data
type
The
protected
operations
provide
mutual
exclusion
You
can
use
a
hybrid
approach
where
you
declare
a
protected
type
with
a
component
of
some
tagged
type
You
then
use
this
protected
type
to
implement
a
new
root
tagged
type
not
a
descendant
of
the
original
tagged
type
Communication
The
need
for
tasks
to
communicate
gives
rise
to
most
of
the
problems
that
make
concurrent
programming
so
difficult
Used
properly
Ada
s
intertask
communication
features
can
improve
the
reliability
of
concurrent

used
thoughtlessly
they

end
loop
source
rationale
To
minimize
the
time
required
to
rendezvous
only
work
that
needs
to
be
performed
during
a
rendezvous
such
as
saving
or
generating
parameters
should
be
allowed
in
the
accept
bodies
When
work
is
removed
from
the
accept
body
and
placed
later
in
the
selective
accept
loop
the
additional
work
might
still
suspend
the
caller
task
If
the
caller
task
calls
entry
Operation
again
before
the
server
task
completes
its
additional
work
the
caller
is
delayed
until
the
server
completes
the
additional
work
If
the
potential
delay
is
unacceptable
and
the
additional
work
does
not
need
to
be
completed
before
the
next
service
of
the
caller
task
the
additional
work
can
form
the
basis
of
a
new
task
that
will
not
block
the
caller
task
Operations
on
protected
objects
incur
less
execution
overhead
than
tasks
and
are
more
efficient
for
data
synchronization
and
communication
than
the
rendezvous
You
must
design
protected
operations
to
be
bounded
short
and
not
potentially
blocking
notes
In
some
cases
additional
functions
can
be
added
to
a
task
For
example
a
task
controlling
a
communication
device
might
be
responsible
for
a
periodic
function
to
ensure
that
the
device
is
operating
correctly
This
type
of
addition
should
be
done
with
care
realizing
that
the
response
time
of
the
task
might
be
impacted
see
the
above
rationale
Minimizing
the
work
performed
during
a
rendezvous
or
selective
accept
loop
of
a
task
can
increase
the
rate
of
execution
only
when
it
results
in
additional
overlaps
in
processing
between
the
caller
and
callee
or
when
other
tasks
can
be
scheduled
due
to
the
shorter
period
of
execution
Therefore
the
largest
increases
in
execution
rates
will
be
seen
in
multiprocessor
environments
In
single
processor
environments
the
increased
execution
rate
will
not
be
as
significant
and
there
might
even
be
a
small
net
loss
The
guideline
is
still
applicable
however
if
the
application
could
ever
be
ported
to
a
multiprocessor
environment

there
are
no
alternatives
without
guards
unless
there
is
an
else
part
When
all
alternatives
are
closed
the
task
can
never
again
progress
so
there
is
by
definition
an
error
in
its
programming
You
must
be
prepared
to
handle
this
error
should
it
occur
Because
an
else
part
cannot
have
a
guard
it
can
never
be
closed
off
as
an
alternative
action
thus
its
presence
prevents
Program
Error
However
an
else
part
a
delay
alternative
and
a
terminate
alternative
are
all
mutually
exclusive
so
you
will
not
always
be
able
to
provide
an
else
part
In
these
cases
you
must
be
prepared
to
handle
Program
Error
The
exception
Tasking
Error
can
be
raised
in
the
calling
task
whenever
it
attempts
to
communicate
There
are
many
situations
permitting
this
Few
of
them
are
preventable
by
the
calling
task
If
an
exception
is
raised
during
a
rendezvous
and
not
handled
in
the
accept
statement
it
is
propagated
to
both
tasks
and
must
be
handled
in
two
places
see
Guideline

The
handling
of
the
others
exception
can
be
used
to
avoid
propagating
unexpected
exceptions
to
callers
when
this
is
the
desired
effect
and
to
localize
the
logic
for
dealing
with
unexpected
exceptions
in
the
rendezvous
After
handling
an
unknown
exception
should
normally
be
raised
again
because
the
final
decision
of
how
to
deal
with
it
might
need
to
be
made
at
the
outermost
scope
of
the
task
body
notes
There
are
other
ways
to
prevent
Program
Error
at
a
selective
accept
These
involve
leaving
at
least
one
alternative
unguarded
or
proving
that
at
least
one
guard
will
evaluate
True
under
all
circumstances
The
point
here
is
that
you
or
your
successors
will
make
mistakes
in
trying
to
do
this
so
you
should
prepare
to
handle
the
inevitable
exception
Attributes

Do

Nissen
and
Wallis
1984
Do
not
depend

to
avoid
Tasking
Error
on
an
entry
call
For
tasks
do
not
depend
on
the
value
of
the
entry
attribute
Count
Using
the
Count
attribute
with
protected
entries
is
more
reliable
than
using
the
Count
attribute
with
task
entries
example
In
the
following
examples
Dispatch
Callable
is
a
Boolean
expression
indicating
whether
a
call
can
be
made
to
the
task
Intercept
without
raising
the
exception
Tasking
Error
Dispatch
Count
indicates
the
number
of
callers
currently
waiting
at
entry
Transmit
Dispatch
Terminated
is
a
Boolean
expression
indicating
whether
the
task
Dispatch
is
in
a
terminated
state
This
task
is
badly
programmed
because
it
relies
upon
the
values
of
the
Count
attributes
not
changing
between
evaluating
and
acting
upon
them
source

Dispatch

source
If
the
following
code
is
preempted
between
evaluating
the
condition
and
initiating
the
call
the
assumption
that
the
task
is
still
callable
might
no
longer
be
valid
source
lang
ada
if
Dispatch

then
Dispatch

end
if
source
rationale
Attributes
Callable
Terminated
and
Count
are
all
subject
to
race
conditions
Between
the
time
you
reference
an
attribute
and
the
time
you
take
action
the
value
of
the
attribute
might
change
Attributes
Callable
and
Terminated
convey
reliable
information
once
they
become
False
and
True
respectively
If
Callable
is
False
you
can
expect
the
callable
state
to
remain
constant
If
Terminated
is
True
you
can
expect
the
task
to
remain
terminated
Otherwise
Terminated
and
Callable
can
change
between
the
time
your
code
tests
them
and
the
time
it
responds
to
the
result
The
Ada
Reference
Manual

itself
warns
about
the
asynchronous
increase
and
decrease
of
the
value
of
Count
A
task
can
be
removed
from
an
entry
queue
due
to
execution
of
an
abort
statement
as
well
as
expiration
of
a
timed
entry
call
The
use
of
this
attribute
in
guards
of
a
selective
accept
statement
might
result
in
the
opening
of
alternatives
that
should
not
be
opened
under
a
changed
value
of
Count
The
value
of
the
attribute
Count
is
stable
for
protected
units
because
any
change
to
an
entry
queue
is
itself
a
protected
action
which
will
not
occur
while
any
other
protected
action
is
already
proceeding
Nevertheless
when
you
use
Count
within
an
entry
barrier
of
a
protected
unit
you
should
remember
that
the
condition
of
the
barrier
is
evaluated
both
before
and
after
queueing
a
given
caller
Unprotected
Shared

guideline
Use
calls
on

Do
not
use
unprotected
shared

Do
not
reference
nonlocal
variables
in
a

If
an
unprotected
shared

is
necessary
use
the

This

or
print

part
of
one
line
followed
by

nondeterministically
This
is
because
there
is
no
synchronization
or
mutual
exclusion
between
the
task
that
reads
a
command
and
the
one
that
acts
on

rationale
There
are
many
techniques
for
protecting
and
synchronizing
data
access
You
must
program
most
of
them
yourself
to
use
them
It
is
difficult
to
write
a
program
that
shares
unprotected
data
correctly
If
it
is
not
done
correctly
the
reliability
of
the
program
suffers
Ada
provides
protected
objects
that
encapsulate
and
provide
synchronized
access
to
protected
data
that
is
shared
between
tasks
Protected
objects
are
expected
to
provide
better
performance
than
the
rendezvous
that
usually
requires
introduction
of
an
additional
task
to
manage
the
shared
data
The
use
of
unprotected
shared
variables
is
more
error
prone
than
the
protected
objects
or
rendezvous
because
the
programmer
must
ensure
that
the
unprotected
shared
variables
are
independently
addressable
and
that
the
actions
of
reading
or
updating
the
same
unprotected
shared
variable
are
sequential

The
first
example
above
has
a
race
condition
requiring
perfect
interleaving
of
execution
This

can
be
made
more
reliable
by
introducing
a
flag
that
is
set
by

and
reset

An

flag

added
to
each

in
order
to
ensure
that
the
interleaving
is
satisfied
However
notice
that
this
approach
requires
a
delay
and
the
associated
rescheduling
Presumably
this
rescheduling
overhead
is
what
is
being
avoided
by
not

rationale
The
implicit
environment
task
does
not
terminate
until
all
other
tasks
have
terminated
The
environment
task
serves
as
a
master
for
all
other
tasks
created
as
part
of
the
execution
of
the
partition
it
awaits
termination
of
all
such
tasks
in
order
to
perform
finalization
of
any
remaining
objects
of
the
partition
Thus
a
partition
will
exist
until
all
library
tasks
are
terminated
A
nonterminating
task
is
a
task
whose
body
consists
of
a
nonterminating
loop
with
no
selective
accept
with
terminate
or
a
task
that
depends
on
a
library
package
Execution
of
a
subprogram
or
block
containing
a
task
cannot
complete
until
the
task
terminates
Any
task
that
calls
a
subprogram
containing
a
nonterminating
task
will
be
delayed
indefinitely
A
task
that
depends
on
a
library
package
cannot
be
forced
to
terminate
using
a
selective
accept
construct
with
alternative
and
should
be
terminated
explicitly
during
program
shutdown
One
way
to
explicitly
shut
down
tasks
that
depend
on
library
packages
is
to
provide
them
with
exit
entries
and
have
the
main
subprogram
call
the
exit
entry
just
before
it
terminates
The
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995

states
that
a
bounded
error
results
from
freeing
a
discriminated
unterminated
task
object
The
danger
lies
in
deallocating
the
discriminants
as
a
result
of
freeing
the
task
object
The
effect
of
unterminated
tasks
containing
bounded
errors
at
the
end
of
program
execution
is
undefined
Execution
of
an
accept
statement
or
of
a
selective
accept
statement
without
an
else
part
a
delay
or
a
terminate
alternative
cannot
proceed
if
no
task
ever
calls
the
entry
s
associated
with
that
statement
This
could
result
in
deadlock
Following
the
guideline
to
provide
a
terminate
alternative
for
every
selective
accept
without
an
else
or
a
delay
entails
programming
multiple
termination
points
in
the
task
body
A
reader
can
easily
know
where
to
look
for
the
normal
termination
points
in
a
task
body
The
termination
points
are
the
end
of
the
body
s
sequence
of
statements
and
alternatives
to
select
statements
When
the
environment
task
has
been
terminated
either
normally
or
abnormally
the
language
does
not
specify
whether
to
await
a
task
activated
during

of
the
controlled
objects
in
a

While
the
environment

is
waiting
for
all

in
the
partition
to

starting
up

rationale
When
an
abort
statement
is
executed
there
is
no
way
to
know
what
the
targeted
task
was
doing
beforehand
Data
for
which
the
target
task
is
responsible
might
be
left
in
an
inconsistent
state
The
overall
effect
on
the
system
of
aborting
a
task
in
such
an
uncontrolled
way
requires
careful
analysis
The
system
design
must
ensure
that
all
tasks
depending
on
the
aborted
task
can
detect
the
termination
and
respond
appropriately
Tasks
are
not
aborted
until
they
reach
an
abort
completion
point
such
as
beginning
or
end
of
elaboration
a
delay
statement
an
accept
statement
an
entry
call
a
select
statement
task
allocation
or
the
execution
of
an
exception
handler
Consequently
the
abort
statement
might
not
release
processor
resources
as
soon
as
you
might
expect
It
also
might
not
stop
a
runaway
task
because
the
task
might
be
executing
an
infinite
loop
containing
no
abort
completion
points
There
is
no
guarantee
that
a
task
will
not
abort
until
an
abort
completion
point
in
multiprocessor
systems
but
the
task
will
almost
always
stop
running
right
away
An
asynchronous
select
statement
allows
an
external
event
to
cause
a
task
to
begin
execution
at
a
new
point
without
having
to
abort
and
restart
the
task
Rationale
1995
9
3
Because
the
triggering
statement
and
the
abortable
statement
execute
in
parallel
until
one
of
them
completes
and
forces
the
other
to
be
abandoned
you
need
only
one
thread
of
control
The
asynchronous
select
statement
improves
maintainability
because
the
abortable
statements
are
clearly
delimited
and
the
transfer
cannot
be
mistakenly
redirected
In
task
bodies
and
in
the
abortable
part
of
an
asynchronous
select
you
should
avoid
assigning
to
nonatomic
global
objects
primarily
because
of
the
risk
of
an
abort
occurring
before
the
nonatomic
assignment
completes
If
you
have
one
or
more
abort
statements
in
your
application
and
the
assignment
is
disrupted
the
target
object
can
become
abnormal
and
subsequent
uses
of
the
object
lead
to
erroneous
execution

rationale
A
task
will
terminate
if
an
exception
is
raised
within
it
for
which
it
has
no
handler
In
such
a
case
the
exception
is
not
propagated
outside
of
the
task
unless
it
occurs
during
a
rendezvous
The
task
simply
dies
with
no
notification
to
other
tasks
in
the
program
Therefore
providing
exception
handlers
within
the
task
and
especially
a
handler
for
others
ensures
that
a
task
can
regain
control
after
an
exception
occurs
If
the
task
cannot
proceed
normally
after
handling
an
exception
this
affords
it
the
opportunity
to
shut
itself
down
cleanly
and
to
notify
tasks
responsible
for
error
recovery
necessitated
by
the
abnormal
termination
of
the
task
You
should
not
use
the
task
status
to
determine
whether
a
rendezvous
can
be
made
with
the
task
If
Task
A
depends
on
Task
B
and
Task
A
checks
the
status
flag
before
it
rendezvouses
with
Task
B
there
is
a
potential
that
Task
B
fails
between
the
status
test
and
the
rendezvous
In
this
case
Task
A
must
provide
an
exception
handler
to
handle
the

Introduction
Discussions
concerning
portability
usually
concentrate
on
the
differences
in
computer
systems
but
the
development
and
run
time
environment
may
also
change
portability

The
ease
with
which
software
can
be
transferred
from
one
computer
system
or
environment
to
another
IEEE
Dictionary

Most
portability
problems
are
not
pure
language
issues
Portability
involves
hardware
byte
order
device
I
O
and
software
utility
libraries
operating
systems
run
time
libraries
This
chapter
will
not
address
these
challenging
design
issues
This
chapter
does
identify
the
more
common
portability
problems
that
are
specific
to
Ada
when
moving
from
one
platform
or
compiler
to
another
It
also
suggests
ways
that
nonportable
code
can
be
isolated
By
using
the
implementation
hiding
features
of
Ada
the
cost
of
porting
can
be
significantly
reduced
In
fact
many
language
portability
issues
are
solved
by
the
strict
definition
of
the
Ada
language
itself
In
most
programming
languages
different
dialects
are
prevalent
as
vendors
extend
or
dilute
a
language
for
various
reasons
conformance
to
a
programming
environment
or
features
for
a
particular
application
domain
The
Ada
Compiler
Validation
Capability
ACVC
was
developed
by
the
U
S
Department
of
Defense
at
the
Ada
Validation
Facility
ASD
SIDL
Wright
Patterson
Air
Force
Base
to
ensure
that
implementors
strictly
adhered
to
the
Ada
standard
As
part
of
the
strict
definition
of
Ada
certain
constructs
are
defined
to
be
erroneous
and
the
effect
of
executing
an
erroneous
construct
is
unpredictable
Therefore
erroneous
constructs
are
obviously
not
portable
Erroneous
constructs
and
bounded
errors
are
discussed
in
Guideline

and
are
not
repeated
in
this
chapter
Most
programmers
new
to
the
language
expect
Ada
to
eliminate
all
portability
problems
it
definitely
does
not
Certain
areas
of
Ada
are
not
yet
covered
by
validation
The
definition
of
Ada
leaves
certain
details
to
the
implementor
The
compiler
implementor
s
choices
with
respect
to
these
details
affect
portability
The
revisions
to
the
Ada
language
approved
in
the
1995
standard
generate
a
new
area
of
portability
concerns
Some
programs
are
intended
to
have
a
long
life
and
may
start
in
Ada
83
Ada
Reference
Manual
1983
but
transition
to
Ada
95
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
Although
this
style
guide
focuses
on
the
current
Ada
standard
and
does
not
address
transition
issues
there
are
portability
issues
relating
to
using
certain
features
of
the
language
These
issues
revolve
around
the
language
features
designated
as
obsolescent
in
Annex
J
of
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
The
constructs
of
the
language
have
been
developed
to
satisfy
a
series
of
needs
These
constructs
can
legitimately
be
used
even
though
they
may
impact
portability
There
are
some
general
principles
to
enhancing
portability
that
are
exemplified
by
many
of
the
guidelines
in
this
chapter
They
are
Recognize
those
Ada
constructs
that
may
adversely
affect
portability
on
the
relevant
implementations
or
platforms
Rely
on
those
Ada
constructs
that
depend
on
characteristics
shared
by
all
relevant
implementations
Avoid
the
use
of
those
constructs
whose
implementation
characteristics
vary
on
the
relevant
platforms
Localize
and
encapsulate
nonportable
features
of
a
program
if
their
use
is
essential
Highlight
the
use
of
constructs
that
may
cause
portability
problems
These
guidelines
cannot
be
applied
thoughtlessly
Many
of
them
involve
a
detailed
understanding
of
the
Ada
model
and
its
implementation
In
many
cases
you
will
have
to
make
carefully
considered
tradeoffs
between
efficiency
and
portability
Reading
this
chapter
should
improve
your
insight
into
the
tradeoffs
involved
The
material
in
this
chapter
was
largely
acquired

tradeoffs

to
give
you
insight

some
of
these
tradeoffs
Fundamentals
This
section
introduces
some
generally
applicable
principles
of
writing
portable
Ada
programs
It
includes
guidelines
about
the
assumptions

should
make
with
respect
to
a
number
of
Ada
features
and
their

and
guidelines
about
the
use
of
other
Ada
features
to

Obsolescent

guideline
In
programs
or
components
intended
to
have
a
long
life
avoid
using
the
features
of
Ada
declared
as
obsolescent
by
Annex
J
of
the
Ada
Reference
Manual

the
use
of
the

is
needed

rationale
Ten
years
of
reflection
on
the
use
of
Ada
83
led
to
the
conclusion
that
some
features
of
the
original
language
are
not
as
useful
as
originally
intended
These
features
have
been
replaced
with
others
in
the
Ada
95
revision
It
would
have
been
desirable
to
remove
the
obsolescent
features
completely
but
that
would
have
prevented
the
upward
compatible
transition
of
programs
from
Ada
83
to
Ada
95
Thus
the
obsolescent
features
remain
in
the
language
and
are
explicitly
labeled
as
such
in
Annex
J
of
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
The
features
listed
in
Annex
J
are
candidates
for
removal
from
the
language
during
its
next
revision
If
a
program
s
lifetime
may
extend
beyond
the
next
language
revision
it
should
avoid
the
obsolescent
language
features
unless
backward
compatibility
with
Ada
83
forces
their
use

rationale
Some
assumptions
must
be
made
with
respect
to
certain
implementation
specific
values
The
exact
values
assumed
should
cover
the
majority
of
the
target
equipment
of
interest
Choosing
the
lowest
common
denominator
for
values
improves
portability
Implementations
may
supply
an
alternate
character
set
specific
to
a
locale
or
environment
For
instance
the
implementation
on
an
IBM
compatible
PC
may
support
that
machine
s
native
character
set
rather
than
Latin
1
As
a
result
some
character
values
may
or
may
not
be
supported
for
example
the
smiley
face
notes
Of
the
microcomputers
currently
available
for
incorporation
within
embedded
systems
16
bit
and
32
bit
processors
are
prevalent
Using
current
representation
schemes
6
decimal
digits
of
floating
point
accuracy
imply
a
representation
mantissa
at
least
21
bits
wide
leaving
11
bits
for
exponent
and
sign
within
a
32
bit
representation
This
correlates
with
the
data
widths
of
floating
point
hardware
currently
available
for
the
embedded
systems
market
A
32
bit
minimum
on
fixed
point
numbers
correlates
with
the
accuracy
and
storage
requirements
of
floating
point
numbers
The
16
bit
example
for
Root
Integer
expressions
matches
that
for
Integer
storage
The
32
bit
integers
can
be
assumed
if
the
application
will
only
be
considered
for
32
bit
processors
with
a
corresponding
32
bit
operating
system
and
supporting
compiler
The
values
for
the
range
and
accuracy
of
values
of
the
predefined
type

are
the
limits
expressed
in
the
Ada

You
should
not
expect
an
implementation
to
provide
a
wider
range
or
a
finer
granularity

To

assume
the
simplest
case
that
the
external

not
support
passing

Some
operating
systems
are
capable
of
acquiring

interpreting

integer
values
near
0
from
a
function
but
many
others
cannot
Further
many
real

embedded
systems
will
not
be
designed
to
terminate
so
a
function
or
a
procedure
having
parameters
with

out
or

will
be
inappropriate
to
such

This
leaves

Although
some

can
pass

even
if
the

notes
Real

embedded
applications
may
not
have
an

initiating
the

it
would
be
more
appropriate
for
the

rationale
Encapsulating
hardware
and
implementation
dependencies
in
a
package
allows
the
remainder
of
the
code
to
ignore
them
and
thus
to
be
fully
portable
It
also
localizes
the
dependencies
making
it
clear
exactly
which
parts
of
the
code
may
need
to
change
when
porting
the
program
Some
implementation
dependent
features
may
be
used
to
achieve
particular
performance
or
efficiency
objectives
Commenting
these
objectives
ensures
that
the
programmer
can
find
an
appropriate
way
to
achieve
them
when
porting
to
a
different
implementation
or
explicitly
recognize
that
they
cannot
be
achieved
Interrupt
entries
are
implementation
dependent
features
that
may
not
be
supported
e
g
VAX
Ada
uses
pragmas
to
assign
system
traps
to
normal
rendezvous
However
interrupt
entries
cannot
be
avoided
in
most
embedded
real
time
systems
and
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
they
are
supported
by
an
Ada
implementation
The
value
for
an
interrupt
is
implementation
defined
Isolate
it
notes
You
can
use
Ada
to
write
machine
dependent
programs
that
take
advantage
of
an
implementation
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
Ada
model
but
that
make
particular
choices
where
Ada
allows
implementation

These
machine

should
be
treated
in
the

While
a
dependency

evaluation
may
not
adversely
affect
the
program
on
a
certain
implementation
the
code
might
not
execute
correctly

is
ported
For
example
if
two
actual
parameters
of
a

call
have
side
effects
the

could
depend
on

Numeric

A
great
deal
of
care
was
taken
with
the

the

features
related
to
numeric
computations
to
ensure
that
the

could
be
used
in

and
mathematical
applications
where
precision
was
important
As
far
as
possible
these
features
were
made
portable
However
there
is
an
inevitable
tradeoff
between
maximally
exploiting
the
available
precision
of
numeric
computation
on
a
particular
machine
and
maximizing
the
portability
of
Ada
numeric
constructs
This
means
that
these
Ada
features
particularly
numeric
types
and
expressions
must
be
used
with
great
care

full

rationale
An
implementor
is
free
to
define
the
range
of
the
predefined
numeric
types
Porting
code
from
an
implementation
with
greater
accuracy
to
one
of
lesser
accuracy
is
a
time
consuming
and
error
prone
process
Many
of
the
errors
are
not
reported
until
run
time
This
applies
to
more
than
just
numerical
computation
An
easy
to
overlook
instance
of
this
problem
occurs
if
you
neglect
to
use
explicitly

for
integer

If
you
do
not
provide
an
explicit
type
when
specifying
index
constraints
and
other
discrete
ranges
a
predefined
integer
type
is
assumed
The
predefined
numeric
types
are
useful
when
you
use
them
wisely
You
should
not
use
them
to
avoid
declaring
numeric
types
then
you
lose
the
benefits
of
strong
typing
When
your
application
deals
with
different
kinds
of
quantities
and
units
you
should
definitely
separate
them
through
the
use
of
distinct
numeric
types
However
if
you
are
simply
counting
the
number
of
iterations
in
an
iterative
approximation
algorithm
declaring
a
special
integer
type
is
probably
overkill
The
predefined
exponentiation
operators
require
an
integer
as
the
type
of
its
right
operand
You
should
use
the
predefined
types
Natural
and
Positive
for
manipulating
certain
kinds
of
values
in
the
predefined
language
environment
The
types
String
and
Wide
String
use
an
index
of
type
Positive
If
your
code
indexes
into
a
string
using
an
incompatible
integer
type
you
will
be
forced
to
do
type
conversion
reducing
its
readability
If
you
are
performing
operations
like
slices
and
concatenation
the
subtype
of
your
numeric
array
index
is
probably
insignificant
and
you
are
better
off
using
a
predefined
subtype
On
the
other
hand
if
your
array
represents
a
table
e
g
a
hash
table
then
your
index
subtype
is
significant
and
you
should
declare
a
distinct
index
type

To

you
should
compile

If
your

of
the
strict

then
it
will
only
be
portable
to

The

effect
of
extra
guard
digits
in
internal
computations
can
sometimes
lower
the
number
of
digits
that
must
be
specified
in
an
Ada
declaration
This
may
not
be
consistent
over
implementations
where
the

be
run
It
may
also
lead
to
the
false
conclusion
that
the

are
sufficient
for

required
You
should
choose
the

to
satisfy
the

number
of

that
will
provide
the

Careful
analysis
will
be
necessary
to
show
that
the

are
adequate
When
you
move
to
a
machine
with
less
precision
you
probably
can
use
the

Just
because

the

not
imply
they

The

require
that
an

perform
range
checks
on

within

Ada
does

that

Thus
depending
on
the

and
the
size
of

a

will
either
overflow
or
produce
the

In

you

rationale
Strict
relational
comparisons
are
a
general
problem
with
computations
involving
real
numbers
Because
of
the
way
comparisons
are
defined
in
terms
of
model
intervals
it
is
possible
for
the
values
of
the
comparisons
to
depend
on
the
implementation
Within
a
model
interval
the
result
of
comparing
two
values
is
nondeterministic
if
the
values
are
not
model
numbers
In
general
you
should
test
for
proximity
rather
than
equality
as
shown
in
the
examples

Type
attributes
are
the
primary
means
of
symbolically
accessing
the
implementation
of
the
Ada
numeric
model
When
the
characteristics
of
the
model
numbers
are
accessed
by
type
attributes
the
source
code
is
portable
The
appropriate
model
numbers
of
any

will
then
be
used
by
the
generated
code
Although
0
is
technically
not
a
special
case
it
is
often
overlooked
because
it
looks
like
the
simplest
and
therefore
safest
case
But
in
reality
each
time
comparisons
involve
small

you
should
evaluate
the
situation
to
determine
which
technique
is
appropriate

Regardless
of

real

That

usually

rationale
The
Ada
language
does
not
provide
any
predefined
decimal
types
Therefore
you
need
to
declare
decimal
types
for
the
different
scales
you
will
need
to
use
Differences
in
scale
and
precision
must
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
common
type
will
suffice
Brosgol
Eachus
and
Emery
1994
You
need
different
types
for
objects
measured
in
different
units
This
allows
the
compiler
to
detect
mismatched
values
in
expressions
If
you
declare
all
decimal
objects
to
be
of
a
single
type
you
forego
the
benefits
of
strong
typing
For
example
in
an
application
that
involves
several
currencies
each
currency
should
be
declared
as
a
separate
type
You
should
provide
appropriate
conversions
between
different
currencies
You
should
map
data
with
no
particular
unit
of
measure
to
a
small
set
of
types
or
a
single
type
to
avoid
the
explosion
of
conversions
between
numeric
types
Separate
the
range
requirement
on
a
decimal
type
from
its
precision
i
e
the
number
of
significant
digits
required
From
the
point
of
view
of
planning
for
change
and
ease
of
maintenance
you
can
use
the
digit
s
value
to
accommodate
future
growth
in
the
values
to
be
stored
in
objects
of
the
type
For
example
you
may
want
to
anticipate
growth
for
database
values
and
report
formats
You
can
constrain
the
values
of
the
type
through
a
range
constraint
that
matches
current
needs
It
is
easier
to
modify
the
range
and
avoid
redefining
databases
and
reports
Ada
automatically
truncates
toward
0
If
your
requirements
are
to
round
the
decimal
result
you
must
explicitly
do
so
using
the
Round
attribute
The
core
language
defines
the
basic
syntax
of
and
operations
on
decimal
types
It
does
not
specify
however
the
minimum
number
of
significant
digits
that
must
be
supported
Nor
does
the
core
language
require
the
compiler
to
support
values
of
Small
other
than
powers
of
2
thus
enabling
the
compiler
effectively
to
reject
a
decimal
declaration
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995

The
Information
Systems
Annex
provides
additional
support
for
decimal
types
It
requires
a
minimum
of
18
significant
digits
It
also
specifies
a
Text
IO
Editing
package
that
provides
support
analogous
to
the
COBOL

approach
Storage
Control
The
management
of
dynamic
storage
can
vary
between
Ada
environments
In
fact
some
environments
do
not
provide
any
deallocation
The
following
Ada
storage
control
mechanisms
are
implementation
dependent
and
should
be
used
with
care
in
writing
portable
programs
Representation
Clause
guideline
Do
not
use
a
representation
clause
to
specify
number
of
storage
units
rationale
The
meaning
of
the
Storage
Size
attribute
is
ambiguous
specifying
a
particular
value
will
not
improve
portability
It
may
or
may
not
include
space
allocated
for
parameters
data
etc
Save
the
use
of
this
feature
for
designs
that
must
depend
on
a
particular
vendor
s
implementation
notes
During
a
porting
activity
it
can
be
assumed
that
any
occurrence
of
storage
specification
indicates
an
implementation
dependency
that
must
be
redesigned
Access
to
Subprogram
Values
guideline
Do
not
compare
access
to
subprogram
values
rationale
The
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
3
10
2
explains
that
an
implementation
may
consider
two
access
to
subprogram
values
to
be
unequal
even
though
they
designate
the
same
subprogram
This
might
be
because
one
points
directly
to
the
subprogram
while
the
other
points
to
a
special
prologue
that
performs
an
Elaboration
Check
and
then
jumps
to
the
subprogram
The
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
4
5
2
states
that
it
is
unspecified
whether
two
access
values
that
designate
the
same
subprogram
but
are
the
result
of
distinct
evaluations
of
Access
attribute
references
are
equal
or
unequal
See
also
Guideline

exceptions
If
you
must
compare
an
access
to
subprogram
value
you
should
define
a
constant
using
the
access
to
subprogram
value
and
make
all
future
comparisons
against
the
constant
However
if
you
attempt
to
compare
access
to
subprogram
values
with
different
levels
of
indirection
the
values
might
still
be
unequal
even
if
designating
the
same
subprogram
Storage
Pool
Mechanisms

Consider
using
explicitly
defined
storage
pool
mechanisms
example
See
the
Ada
Reference
Manual

You
use
allocators
as
before
Instead
of
using
unchecked
deallocation
you
maintain
your
own
free
lists
of
objects
that
are
no
longer
in
use
and
available
for
reuse
You
use
allocators
and
possibly
unchecked
deallocation
however
you
implement
a
storage
pool
and
associate
it
with
the
access
type
s
via
a
Storage
Pool
clause
You
can
use
this
technique
to
implement
a
mark
release
storage
management
paradigm
which
might
be
significantly
faster
than
an
allocate
deallocate
paradigm
Some
vendors
may
provide
a
mark
release
package
as
part
of
their
Ada
environment
You
do
not
use
allocators
but
instead
use
unchecked
conversion
from
the
address
and
do
all
your
own
default
initialization
etc
It
is
unlikely
you
would
use
this
last
option
because
you
lose
automatic
default
initialization
Tasking
The
definition
of
tasking
in
the
Ada
language
leaves
many
characteristics
of
the
tasking
model
up
to
the
implementor
This
allows
a
vendor
to
make
appropriate
tradeoffs
for
the
intended
application
domain
but
it
also
diminishes
the
portability
of
designs
and
code
employing
the
tasking
features
In
some
respects
this
diminished
portability
is
an
inherent
characteristic
of
concurrency
approaches

and
Wallis

If
the

and
therefore
a

In

Exceptions
You
should
exercise
care
when
using
predefined
exceptions
because
aspects
of
their
treatment
may
vary
between
implementations
Implementation
specific
exceptions
must
of
course
be
avoided

Exceptions
guideline
Do
not
depend
on
the
exact
locations
at
which
predefined
exceptions
are
raised
Do
not
rely
on
the
behavior
of
Ada
Exceptions
beyond
the
minimum
defined
in
the
language
rationale
The
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995

states
that
among
implementations
a
predefined
exception
for
the
same
cause
may
be
raised
from
different
locations
You
will
not
be
able
to
discriminate
between
the
exceptions
Further
each
of
the
predefined
exceptions
is
associated
with
a
variety
of
conditions
Any
exception
handler
written
for
a
predefined
exception
must
be
prepared
to
deal
with
any
of
these
conditions

Implementation
Specific
Exceptions
guideline
Do
not
raise
implementation
specific
exceptions
Convert
implementation
specific
exceptions
within
interface
packages
to
visible
user
defined
exceptions
rationale
No
exception
defined
specifically
by
an
implementation
can
be
guaranteed
to
be
portable
to
other
implementations
whether
or
not
they
are
from
the
same
vendor
Not
only
may
the
names
be
different
but
the
range
of
conditions
triggering
the
exceptions
may
be
different
also
If
you
create
interface
packages
for
the
implementation
specific
portions
of
your
program
those
packages
can
catch
or
recognize
implementation
specific
exceptions
and
convert
them
into
user
defined
exceptions
that
have
been
declared
in
the
specification
Do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
forced
to
find
and
change
the
name
of
every
handler
you
have
written
for
these
exceptions
when
the
program
is
ported
Representation
Clauses
And
Implementation
Dependent
Features
Ada
provides
many
implementation
dependent
features
that
permit
greater
control
over
and
interaction
with
the
underlying
hardware
architecture
than
is
normally
provided
by
a
high
order
language
These
mechanisms
are
intended
to
assist
in
systems
programming
and
real
time
programming
to
obtain
greater
efficiency
e
g
specific
size
and
layout
of
variables
through
representation
clauses
and
direct
hardware
interaction
e
g
interrupt
entries
without
having
to
resort
to
assembly
level
programming
Given
the
objectives
for
these
features
it
is
not
surprising
that
you
must
usually
pay
a
significant
price
in
portability
to
use
them
In
general
where
portability
is
the
main
objective
do
not
use
these
features
When
you
must
use
these
features
encapsulate
them
in
packages
that
are
well
commented
as
interfacing
to
the
particular
target
environment
This
section
identifies
the
various
features
and
their
recommended
use
with
respect
to
portability
Representation
Clauses
guideline
Use
algorithms
that
do
not
depend
on
the
representation
of
the
data
and
therefore
do
not
need
representation
clauses
Consider
using
representation
clauses
when
accessing
or
defining
interface
data
or
when
a
specific
representation
is
needed
to
implement
a
design
Do
not
assume
that
sharing
source
files
between
programs
guarantees
the
same
representation
of
data
types
in
those
files
rationale
In
many
cases
it
is
easy
to
use
representation
clauses
to
implement
an
algorithm
even
when
it
is
not
necessary
There
is
also
a
tendency
to
document
the
original
programmer
s
assumptions
about
the
representation
for
future
reference
But
there
is
no
guarantee
that
another
implementation
will
support
the
representation
chosen
Unnecessary
representation
clauses
also
confuse
porting
or
maintenance
efforts
which
must
assume
that
the
programmer
depends
on
the
documented
representation
Interfaces
to
external
systems
and
devices
are
the
most
common
situations
where
a
representation
clause
is
needed
Uses
of
pragma
Import
and
address
clauses
should
be
evaluated
during
design
and
porting
to
determine
whether
a
representation
clause
is
needed
Without
representation
clauses
the
language
does
not
require
two
compilations
of
an
unchanged
file
to
result
in
the
same
data
representation
Things
that
can
change
the
representation
between
compilations
include
A
change
in
a
file
earlier
in
the
compilation
order
A
change
in
the
optimization
strategy
or
level
A
change
in
versions
of
the
compiler
A
change
in
actual
compilers
A
change
in
the
availability
of
system
resources
Therefore
two
independently
linked
programs
or
partitions
should
only
share
data
that
has
their
representations
explicitly
controlled
notes
During
a
porting
effort
all
representation
clauses
can
be
evaluated
as
either
design
artifacts
or
specifications
for
accessing
interface
data
that
might
change
with
a
new
implementation
Package
System
guideline
Avoid
using
package
System
constants
except
in
attempting
to
generalize
other
machine
dependent
constructs
rationale
Because
the
values
in
this
package
are
implementation
provided
unexpected
effects
can
result
from
their
use
notes
If
you
must
guarantee
that
physical
record
layouts
will
remain
the
same
between
implementations
you
can
express
record
fields
by
their
first
and
last
bit
positions
as
shown
in
the
Ada
Reference

and
named

should
be
used
to

In
this
case
greater
portability
can
be
achieved
by

Machine
Code
Inserts
guideline
Avoid
machine
code
inserts
rationale
The
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
Annex
C
suggests
that
the
package
that
implements
machine
code
inserts
is
optional
Additionally
it
is
not
standardized
so
that
machine
code
inserts
are
most
likely
not
portable
In
fact
it
is
possible
that
two
different
vendors
syntax
will
differ
for
an
identical
target
and
differences
in
lower
level
details
such
as
register
conventions
will
hinder
portability
exceptions
If
machine
code
inserts
must
be
used
to
meet
another
project
requirement
recognize
and
document
the
portability
decreasing
effects
In
the
declarative
region
of
the
body
of
the
routine
where
machine
code
inserts
are
being
used
insert
comments
explaining
what
functions
inserts
provide
and
especially
why
the
inserts
are
necessary

delineating
what

Interfacing
to
Foreign
Languages
guideline
Use
the
package
Interfaces
and
its
language
defined
child
packages
rather
than
implementation
specific
mechanisms
Consider
using
pragma
Import
rather
than
access
to
subprogram
types
for
interfacing
to
subprograms
in
other
languages
Preferably
using
the
External

argument
Isolate
all

rationale
For
static
interfacing
to
subprograms
in
other
languages
the
pragma
Import
provides
a
better
solution
than
access
to
subprograms
because
no
indirection
is
required
The
pragma
Interface
Ada
Reference
Manual
1983
has
been
replaced
by
pragmas
Import
Export
and
Convention
Annex
B
of
the
Rationale
1995
discusses
how
to
use
these
pragmas
in
conjunction
with
the
access
to
subprogram
types
in
interfacing
to
other
languages
Note
especially
the
distinction
between
the
External
Name
and
Link
Name
parameters
to
pragma
Import
which
are
frequently
confused
External
Name
specifies
the
procedure
name
as
it
appears
in
the
source
code
of
the
other
language
such
as
C
or
Fortran
Link
Name
specifies
the
name
used
by
the
linker
Typically
only
one
of
these
parameters
is
specified
and
generally
External
Name
is
the
preferred
choice
for
portability
Access
to
subprogram
types
is
useful
for
implementing
callbacks
in
a
separate
subsystem
such
as
the
X
Window
system
The
problems
with
interfacing
to
foreign
languages
are
complex
These
problems
include
pragma
syntax
differences
conventions
for
linking
binding
Ada
to
other
languages
and
mapping
Ada
variables
to
foreign
language
variables
By
hiding
these
dependencies
within
interface
packages
the
amount
of
code
modification
can
be
reduced
exceptions
It
is
often
necessary
to
interact
with
other
languages
if
only
an
assembly

reach
certain

Implementation
Specific
Pragmas
and
Attributes
guideline
Avoid
pragmas
and
attributes
added
by
the
compiler
implementor
rationale
The
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
permits
an
implementor
to
add
pragmas
and
attributes
to
exploit
a
particular
hardware
architecture
or
software
environment
These
are
obviously
even
more
implementation
specific
and
therefore
less
portable
than
an
implementor
s
interpretations
of
the
predefined
pragmas
and
attributes
However
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
defines
a
set
of
annexes
that
have
a
uniform
and
consistent
approach
to
certain
specialized
needs
namely
real
time
systems
distributed
systems
information
systems
numerics
interfacing
to
foreign
languages
and
safety
and
security
You
should
always
prefer
the
facilities
defined
in
the
annexes
to
any
vendor
defined
pragmas
and
attributes
Unchecked
Deallocation
guideline
Avoid
dependence
on
Ada
Unchecked
Deallocation
see
Guideline
5

2
rationale
The
unchecked
storage
deallocation
mechanism
is
one
method
for
overriding
the
default
time
at
which
allocated
storage
is
reclaimed
The
earliest
default
time
is
when
an
object
is
no
longer
accessible
for
example
when
control
leaves
the
scope
where
an
access
type
was
declared
the
exact
point
after
this
time
is
implementation
dependent
Any
unchecked
deallocation
of
storage
performed
prior
to
this
may
result
in
an
erroneous
Ada
program
if
an
attempt
is
made
to
access
the
object
This
guideline
is
stronger
than
Guideline
5

2
because
of
the
extreme
dependence
on
the
implementation
of
Ada
Unchecked
Deallocation
Using
it
could
cause
considerable
difficulty
with
portability
notes
Ada
Unchecked
Deallocation
is
a
supported
feature
in
all
Ada
implementations
The
portability
issue
arises
in
that
unchecked
storage
deallocations
might
cause
varying
results
in
different
implementations
exceptions
Using
unchecked
deallocation
of
storage
can
be
beneficial
in
local
control
of
highly
iterative
or
recursive
algorithms
where
available
storage
may
be
exceeded
Unchecked
Access
guideline
Avoid
dependence
on
the
attribute
Unchecked
Access
see
Guideline
5
9
2
rationale
Access
values
are
subject
to
accessibility
restrictions
Using
the
attribute
Unchecked
Access
prevents
these
rules
from
being
checked
and
the
programmer
runs
the
risk
of
having
dangling
references
Unchecked
Conversion
guideline
Avoid
dependence
on
Ada
Unchecked
Conversion
see
Guideline
5

1
rationale
The
unchecked
type
conversion
mechanism
is
in
effect
a
means
of
bypassing
the
strong
typing
facilities
in
Ada
An
implementation
is
free
to
limit
the
types
that
may
be
matched
and
the
results
that
occur
when
object
sizes
differ
exceptions
Unchecked
type
conversion
is
useful
in
implementation
dependent
parts
of
Ada
programs
where
lack
of
portability
is
isolated
and
where
low
level
programming
and
foreign
language
interfacing
are
the
objectives
If
an
enumeration
representation
clause
is
used
unchecked
type
conversion
is
the
only
language
provided
way
to
retrieve
the
internal
integer
code
of
an
enumeration
value
Run

Avoid
the

except
where

rationale
Features
of
an
implementation
not
specified
in

Manual
1995
will
usually
differ
between
implementations
Specific
implementation
dependent
features
are
not
likely
to
be
provided
in
other
implementations
In
addition
to
the
mandatory
predefined
language
environment
the
annexes
define
various
packages
attributes
and
pragmas
to
standardize
implementation
dependent
features
for
several
specialized
domains
You
enhance
portability
when
you
use
the
features
declared
in
the
packages
in
the
Annexes
because
you
can
port
your
program
to
other
vendor
environments
that
implement
the
same
Annexes
you
have
used
Even
if
a
majority
of
vendors
eventually
provide
similar
features
they
are
unlikely
to
have
identical
formulations
Indeed
different
vendors
may
use
the
same
formulation
for
semantically
entirely
different
features
When
coding

to
avoid
depending
on
the
underlying

Consider
the
consequences
of
including
system
calls
in
a
program
on
a
host
development
system
If
these
calls
are
not
flagged
for
removal
and
replacement
the
program
could
go
through
development
and
testing
only
to
be
unusable

Providing

The
section
on
Input

in
ARTEWG

provides
some
examples
of
this
kind
of
dependency
Embedded
applications
have
different
dependencies
that
often
tie
them
to
the
low

details
of
their

The
major
defense
against
these
inherent
implementation
dependencies
in
I
O
is
to
try
to
isolate
their
functionality
in
any
given
application
The

of

focused
in
this
direction
Name

Isolation
of

Not

does
not
guarantee

does
not

the
effects
of
I
O
on
access
types
When
such
a
value
is
written
it
is
placed
out
of
reach
of
the
implementation
Thus
it
is
out
of
reach
of
the
reliability
enhancing
controls
of
strong
type
checking
Consider
the
meaning
of
this
operation
One
possible
implementation
of
the
values
of
access
types
is
virtual
addresses
If
you
write
such
a
value
how
can
you
expect
another
program
to
read
that
value
and
make
any
sensible
use
of
it
The
value
cannot
be
construed
to
refer
to
any
meaningful
location
within
the
reader
s
address
space
nor
can
a
reader
infer
any
information
about
the
writer
s
address
space
from
the
value
read
The
latter
is
the
same
problem
that
the
writer
would
have
trying
to
interpret
or
use
the
value
if
it
is
read

Introduction
Reusability
is
the
extent
to
which
code
can
be
used
in
different
applications
with
minimal
change
As
code
is
reused
in
a
new
application
that
new
application
partially
inherits
the
attributes
of
that
code
If
the
code
is
maintainable
the
application
is
more
maintainable
If
it
is
portable
then
the
application
is
more
portable
So
this
chapter
s
guidelines
are
most
useful
when
all
of
the
other
guidelines
in
this
book
are
also
applied
Several
guidelines
are
directed
at
the
issue
of
maintainability
Maintainable
code
is
easy
to
change
to
meet
new
or
changing
requirements
Maintainability
plays
a
special
role
in
reuse
When
attempts
are
made
to
reuse
code
it
is
often
necessary
to
change
it
to
suit
the
new
application
If
the
code
cannot
be
changed
easily
it
is
less
likely
to
be
reused
There
are
many
issues
involved
in
software
reuse
whether
to
reuse
parts
how
to
store
and
retrieve
reusable
parts
in
a
library
how
to
certify
parts
how
to
maximize
the
economic
value
of
reuse
how
to
provide
incentives
to
engineers
and
entire
companies
to
reuse
parts
rather
than
reinvent
them
and
so
on
This
chapter
ignores
these
managerial
economic
and
logistic
issues
to
focus
on
the
single
technical
issue
of
how
to
write
software
parts
in
Ada
to
increase
reuse
potential
The
other
issues
are
just
as
important
but
are
outside
of
the
scope
of
this
book
One
of
the
design
goals
of
Ada
was
to
facilitate
the
creation
and
use
of
reusable
parts
to
improve
productivity
To
this
end
Ada
provides
features
to
develop
reusable
parts
and
to
adapt
them
once
they
are
available
Packages
visibility
control
and
separate
compilation
support
modularity
and
information
hiding
see
guidelines
in

This
allows
the
separation
of
application
specific
parts
of
the
code
maximizes
the
general
purpose
parts
suitable
for
reuse
and
allows
the
isolation
of
design
decisions
within
modules
facilitating
change
The
Ada
type
system
supports
localization
of
data
definitions
so
that
consistent
changes
are
easy
to
make
The
Ada
inheritance
features
support
type
extension
so
that
data
definitions
and
interfaces
may
be
customized
for
an
application
Generic
units
directly
support
the
development
of
general
purpose
adaptable
code
that
can
be
instantiated
to
perform
specific
functions
The
Ada
95
improvements
for
object
oriented
techniques
and
abstraction
support
all
of
the
above
goals
Using
these
features
carefully
and
in
conformance
to
the
guidelines
in
this
book
produces
code
that
is
more
likely
to
be
reusable
Reusable
code
is
developed
in
many
ways
Code
may
be
scavenged
from
a
previous
project
A
reusable
library
of
code
may
be
developed
from
scratch
for
a
particularly
well
understood
domain
such
as
a
math
library
Reusable
code
may
be
developed
as
an
intentional
byproduct
of
a
specific
application
Reusable
code
may
be
developed
a
certain
way
because
a
design
method
requires
it
These
guidelines
are
intended
to
apply
in
all
of
these
situations
The
experienced
programmer
recognizes
that
software
reuse
is
much
more
a
requirements
and
design
issue
than
a
coding
issue
The
guidelines
in
this
section
are
intended
to
work
within
an
overall
method
for
developing
reusable
code
This
section
will
not
deal
with
artifacts
of
design
testing
etc
Some
research
into
reuse
issues
related
specifically
to
the
Ada
language
can
be
found
in
AIRMICS
1990
Edwards
1990
and
Wheeler
1992
Regardless
of
development
method
experience
indicates
that
reusable
code
has
certain
characteristics
and
this
chapter
makes
the
following
assumptions
Reusable
parts
must
be
understandable
A
reusable
part
should
be
a
model
of
clarity
The
requirements
for
commenting
reusable
parts
are
even
more
stringent
than
those
for
parts
specific
to
a
particular
application
Reusable
parts
must
be
of
the
highest
possible
quality
They
must
be
correct
reliable
and
robust
An
error
or
weakness
in
a
reusable
part
may
have
far
reaching
consequences
and
it
is
important
that
other
programmers
can
have
a
high
degree
of
confidence
in
any
parts
offered
for
reuse
Reusable
parts
must
be
adaptable
To
maximize
its
reuse
potential
a
reusable
part
must
be
able
to
adapt
to
the
needs
of
a
wide
variety
of
users
Reusable
parts
should
be
independent
It
should
be
possible
to
reuse
a
single
part
without
also
adopting
many
other
parts
that
are
apparently
unrelated
In
addition
to
these
criteria
a
reusable
part
must
be
easier
to
reuse
than
to
reinvent
must
be
efficient
and
must
be
portable
If
it
takes
more
effort
to
reuse
a
part
than
to
create
one
from
scratch
or
if
the
reused
part
is
simply
not
efficient
enough
reuse
does
not
occur
as
readily
For
guidelines
on
portability
see
Chapter
7
This
chapter
should
not
be
read
in
isolation
In
many
respects
a
well
written
reusable
component
is
simply
an
extreme
example
of
a
well
written
component
All
of
the
guidelines
in
the
previous
chapters
and
in
Chapter
9
apply
to
reusable
components
as
well
as
components
specific
to
a
single
application
As
experience
increases
with
the
1995
revision
to
the
Ada
standard
new
guidelines
may
emerge
while
others
may
change
The
guidelines
listed
here
apply
specifically
to
reusable
components
Guidelines
in
this
chapter
are
frequently
worded
consider
because
hard
and
fast
rules
cannot
apply
in
all
situations
The
specific
choice
you
can
make
in
a
given
situation
involves
design
tradeoffs
The
rationale
for
these
guidelines
is
intended
to
give
you
insight
into
some
of
these
tradeoffs
Understanding
and
Clarity
It
is
particularly
important
that
parts
intended
for
reuse
should
be
easy
to
understand
What
the
part
does
how
to
use
it
what
anticipated
changes
might
be
made
to
it
in
the
future
and
how
it
works
are
facts
that
must
be
immediately
apparent
from
inspection
of
the
comments
and
the
code
itself
For
maximum
readability
of
reusable
parts
follow
the
guidelines
in
Chapter
3
some
of
which
are
repeated
more
strongly
below
Application
Independent
Naming
guideline
Select
the
least
restrictive
names
possible
for
reusable
parts
and
their
identifiers
Select
the
generic
name
to
avoid
conflicting
with
the
naming
conventions
of
instantiations
of
the
generic
Use
names
that
indicate
the
behavioral
characteristics
of
the
reusable
part
as
well
as
its
abstraction
example
General
purpose
stack
abstraction
source
lang
ada
generic
type
Item
is
private
package
Bounded
Stack
is
procedure
Push
New
Item
in
Item
procedure
Pop
Newest
Item
out
Item
end
Bounded
Stack
source
Renamed
appropriately
for
use
in
current
application
source
lang
ada
with
Bounded
Stack
type
Tray
is
package
Tray
Stack

Bounded
Stack
Item
Tray
source
rationale
Choosing
a
general
or
application
independent
name
for
a
reusable
part
encourages
its
wide
reuse
When
the
part
is
used
in
a
specific
context
it
can
be
instantiated
if
generic
or
renamed
with
a
more
specific
name
When
there
is
an
obvious
choice
for
the
simplest
clearest
name
for
a
reusable
part
it
is
a
good
idea
to
leave
that
name
for
use
by
the
reuser
of
the
part
choosing
a
longer
more
descriptive
name
for
the
reusable
part
Thus
Bounded
Stack
is
a
better
name
than
Stack
for
a
generic
stack
package
because
it
leaves
the
simpler
name
Stack
available
to
be
used
by
an
instantiation
Include
indications
of
the
behavioral
characteristics
but
not
indications
of
the
implementation
in
the
name
of
a
reusable
part
so
that
multiple
parts
with
the
same
abstraction
e
g
multiple
stack
packages
but
with
different
restrictions
bounded
unbounded
etc
can
be
stored
in
the
same
Ada
library
and
used
as
part
of
the
same
Ada
program
Abbreviations
guideline
Do
not
use
abbreviations
in
identifier
or
unit
names
example
source
lang
ada
with
Ada
Calendar
package
Greenwich
Mean
Time
is
function
Clock
return
Ada
Calendar
Time
end
Greenwich
Mean
Time

The
following
abbreviation
may
not
be
clear
when
used
in
an
application
source
lang
ada
with
Ada
Calendar
with
Greenwich
Mean
Time
function
Get
GMT
return
Ada
Calendar
Time
renames
Greenwich
Mean
Time
Clock
source
rationale
This
is
a
stronger
guideline
than
Guideline
3
1
4
However
well
commented
an
abbreviation
may
cause
confusion
in
some
future
reuse
context
Even
universally
accepted
abbreviations
such
as
GMT
for
Greenwich
Mean
Time
can
cause
problems
and
should
be
used
only
with
great
caution
The
difference
between
this
guideline
and
Guideline
3
1
4
involves
issues
of
domain
When
the
domain
is
well
defined
abbreviations
and
acronyms
that
are
accepted
in
that
domain
will
clarify
the
meaning
of
the
application
When
that
same
code
is
removed
from
its
domain
specific
context
those
abbreviations
may
become
meaningless
In
the
example
above
the
package
Greenwich
Mean
Time
could
be
used
in
any
application
without
loss
of
meaning
But
the
function
Get
GMT
could
easily
be
confused
with
some
other
acronym
in
a
different
domain
notes
See
Guideline

concerning
the
proper
use
of
the
renames
clause
If
a
particular
application
makes
extensive
use
of
the
Greenwich
Mean

it
may
be
appropriate
to
rename
the
package

Generic

guideline
Document
the
expected
behavior
of
generic
formal
parameters
just
as
you
document
any
package
specification
example
The
following
example
shows
how
a
very
general

can
be
developed
but
must
be
clearly
documented
to

The

rationale
The
generic
capability
is
one
of
Ada
s
strongest
features
because
of
its
formalization
However
not
all
of
the
assumptions
made
about
generic
formal
parameters
can
be
expressed
directly
in
Ada
It
is
important
that
any
user
of
a
generic
know
exactly
what
that
generic
needs
in
order
to
behave
correctly
In
a
sense
a
generic
specification
is
a
contract
where
the
instantiator
must
supply
the
formal
parameters
and
in
return
receives
a
working
instance
of
the
specification
Both
parties
are
best
served
when
the
contract
is
complete
and
clear
about
all
assumptions
Robustness
The
following
guidelines
improve
the
robustness
of
Ada
code
It
is
easy
to
write
code
that
depends
on
an
assumption
that
you
do
not
realize
that
you
are
making
When
such
a
part
is
reused
in
a
different
environment
it
can
break
unexpectedly
The
guidelines
in
this
section
show
some
ways
in
which
Ada
code
can
be
made
to
automatically
conform
to
its
environment
and
some
ways
in
which
it
can
be
made
to
check
for
violations
of
assumptions
Finally
some
guidelines
are
given
to
warn
you
about
errors
that
Ada
does
not
catch
as
soon
as
you
might
like
Named
Numbers
guideline
Use
named
numbers
and
static
expressions
to
allow
multiple
dependencies
to
be
linked
to
a
small

rationale
To
reuse
software
that
uses
named
numbers
and
static
expressions
appropriately
just
one
or
a
small
number
of
constants
need
to
be
reset
and
all
declarations
and
associated
code
are
changed
automatically
Apart
from
easing
reuse
this
reduces
the
number
of
opportunities
for
error
and
documents
the
meanings
of
the
types
and
constants
without
using
error
prone
comments
Unconstrained
Arrays
guideline
Use
unconstrained
array
types
for
array
formal
parameters
and
array
return
values
Make
the
size
of
local
variables
depend
on

rationale
Unconstrained
arrays
can
be
declared
with
their
sizes
dependent
on
formal
parameter
sizes
When
used
as
local
variables
their
sizes
change
automatically
with
the
supplied
actual
parameters
This
facility
can
be
used
to
assist
in
the
adaptation
of
a
part
because
necessary
size
changes
in
local
variables
are
taken
care
of
automatically
Minimizing
and
Documenting
Assumptions
guideline
Minimize
the
number
of
assumptions
made
by
a
unit
For
assumptions
that
cannot
be
avoided
use
subtypes
or
constraints
to
automatically
enforce
conformance
For
assumptions
that
cannot
be
automatically
enforced
by
subtypes
add
explicit
checks
to
the
code
Document
all
assumptions
If
the
code
depends
upon
the
implementation
of
a
specific
Special

again
in
another
program
especially
if
the
other

likely

people
should
be
robust
It
should
defend
itself
against
misuse
by
defining
its

to
enforce
as
many
assumptions
as
possible
and
by
adding
explicit
defensive
checks
on
anything
that

Annex
you
warn
the
user
that
he
should
only
reuse
the
component
in
a
compilation
environment
that
provides
the
necessary
support
notes
You
can
restrict
the
ranges
of
values
of
the
inputs
by
careful
selection
or
construction
of
the
subtypes
of
the
formal
parameters
When
you
do
so
the
compiler
generated
checking
code
may
be
more
efficient
than
any
checks
you
might
write
Indeed
such
checking
is
part
of
the
intent
of
the
strong
typing
in
the
language
This
presents
a
challenge
however
for
generic
units
where
the
user
of
your
code
selects
the
types
of
the
parameters
Your
code
must
be
constructed
to
deal
with
any
value
of
any
subtype
the
user
may
choose
to
select
for
an
instantiation

Beware
of

example
In

it
appears
that
any

supplied
for

would
be
constrained
to
the
range
1

It
also
appears
that
parameters
passed
at
run
time
to
the
Put

in
any
instantiation
and
values
returned
by
the

would

Constraint
Error
is
raised
when
this
instantiation
is
executed
rationale
The
language
specifies
that
when
constraint
checking
is
performed
for
generic
formal
objects
and
parameters
and
return
values
of
generic
formal
subprograms
the
constraints
of
the
actual
subtype
not
the
formal
subtype
are
enforced
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
12
4
and
12
6
Thus
the
subtype
specified
in
a
formal
in
out
object
parameter
and
the
subtypes
specified
in
the
profile
of
a
formal
subprogram
need
not
match
those
of
the
actual
object
or
subprogram
Thus
even
with
a
generic
unit
that
has
been
instantiated
and
tested
many
times
and
with
an
instantiation
that
reported
no
errors
at
instantiation
time
there
can
be
a
run
time
error
Because
the
subtype
constraints
of
the
generic
formal
are
ignored
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
12
4
and
12
6
suggests
using
the
name
of
a
base
type
in
such
places
to
avoid
confusion
Even
so
you
must
be
careful
not
to
assume
the
freedom
to
use
any
value
of
the
base
type
because
the
instantiation
imposes
the
subtype
constraints
of
the
generic
actual
parameter
To
be
safe
always
refer
to
specific
values
of
the
type
via
symbolic
expressions
containing
attributes
like
First
Last
Pred
and
Succ
rather
than
via
literal
values
For
generics
attributes
provide
the
means
to
maintain
generality
It
is
possible
to
use
literal
values
but
literals
run
the
risk
of
violating
some
constraint
For
example
assuming
that
an
array
s
index
starts
at
1
may
cause
a
problem
when
the
generic
is
instantiated
for
a
zero
based
array
type
notes
Adding
a
generic
formal
parameter
that
defines
the
subtype
of
the
generic
formal
object
does
not
address
the
ramifications
of
the
constraint
checking
rule
discussed
in
the
above
rationale
You
can
instantiate
the
generic
formal
type
with
any
allowable
subtype
and
you
are
not
guaranteed
that
this
subtype
is
the
first
subtype
source
lang
ada

You

However
the

be
of

Overloading
in
Generic
Units
guideline
Be
careful
about
overloading
the
names
of
subprograms
exported
by
the
same
generic
package
example
source
lang
ada
generic
type
Item
is
limited
private
package
Input
Output
is
procedure
Put
Value
in
Integer
procedure
Put
Value
in
Item
end
Input
Output
source
rationale
If
the
generic
package
shown
in
the
example
above
is
instantiated
with
Integer
or
any
subtype
of
Integer
as
the
actual
type
corresponding
to
generic
formal
Item
then
the
two
Put
procedures
have
identical
interfaces
and
all
calls
to
Put
are
ambiguous
Therefore
this
package
cannot
be
used
with
type
Integer
In
such
a
case
it
is
better
to
give
unambiguous
names
to
all
subprograms

parameters
are
accessed
from
a

hidden
inside
the
generic
unit
Document
any
multithreaded
components
rationale
The
effects
of
tasking
become
a
major
factor
when
reusable
code
enters
the
domain
of
real
time
systems
Even
though
tasks
may
be
used
for
other
purposes
their
effect
on
scheduling
algorithms
is
still
a
concern
and
must
be
clearly
documented
With
the
task
clearly
documented
the
real
time
programmer
can
then
analyze
performance
priorities
and
so
forth
to
meet
timing
requirements
or
if
necessary
he
can
modify
or
even
redesign
the
component
Concurrent
access
to
datastructures
must
be
carefully
planned
to
avoid
errors
especially
for
data
structures
that
are
not
atomic
see
Chapter
6
for
details
If
a
generic
unit
accesses
one
of
its
generic
formal
parameters
reads
or
writes
the
value
of
a
generic
formal
object
or
calls
a
generic
formal
subprogram
that
reads
or
writes
data
from
within
a
task
contained
in
the
generic
unit
then
there
is
the
possibility
of
concurrent
access
for
which
the
user
may
not
have
planned
In
such
a
case
the
user
should
be
warned
by
a
comment
in
the
generic
specification

rationale
On
most
occasions
an
exception
is
raised
because
an
undesired
event
such
as
floating
point
overflow
has
occurred
Such
events
often
need
to
be
dealt
with
entirely
differently
with
different
uses
of
a
particular
software
part
It
is
very
difficult
to
anticipate
all
the
ways
that
users
of
the
part
may
wish
to
have
the
exceptions
handled
Passing
the
exception
out
of
the
part
is
the
safest
treatment
In
particular
when
an
exception
is
raised
by
a
generic
formal
subprogram
the
generic
unit
is
in
no
position
to
understand
why
or
to
know
what
corrective
action
to
take
Therefore
such
exceptions
should
always
be
propagated
back
to
the
caller
of
the
generic
instantiation
However
the
generic
unit
must
first
clean
up
after
itself
restoring
its
internal
data
structures
to
a
correct
state
so
that
future
calls
may
be
made
to
it
after
the
caller
has
dealt
with
the
current
exception
For
this
reason
all
calls
to
generic
formal
subprograms
should
be
within
the
scope
of
a
when
others
exception
handler
if
the
internal
state
is
modified
as
shown
in
the
example
above
When
a
reusable
part
is
invoked
the
user
of
the
part
should
be
able
to
know
exactly
what
operation
at
the
appropriate
level
of
abstraction
has
been
performed
For
this
to
be
possible
a
reusable
part
must
always
do
all
or
none
of
its
specified
function
it
must
never
do
half
Therefore
any
reusable
part
that
terminates
early
by
raising
or
propagating
an
exception
should
return
to
the
caller
with
no
effect
on
the
internal
or
external
state
The
easiest
way
to
do
this
is
to
test
for
all
possible
exceptional
conditions
before
making
any
state
changes
modifying
internal
state
variables
making
calls
to
other
reusable
parts
to
modify
their
states
updating
files
etc
When
this
is
not
possible
it
is
best
to
restore
all
internal
and
external
states
to
the
values
that
were
current
when
the
part
was
invoked
before
raising
or
propagating
the
exception
Even
when
this
is
not
possible
it
is
important
to
document
this
potentially
hazardous
situation
in
the
comment
header
of
the
specification
of
the
part
A
similar
problem
arises
with
parameters
of
mode
out
or
in
out
when
exceptions
are
raised
The
Ada
language
distinguishes
between
by
copy
and
by
reference
parameter
passing
In
some
cases
by
copy
is
required
in
other
cases
by
reference
is
required
and
in
the
remaining
cases
either
mechanism
is
allowed
The
potential
problem
arises
in
those
cases
where
the
language
does
not
specify
the
parameter
passing
mechanism
to
use
When
an
exception
is
raised
the
copy
back
does
not
occur
but
for
an
Ada
compiler
which
passes
parameters
by
reference
in
those
cases
where
a
choice
is
allowed
the
actual
parameter
has
already
been
updated
When
parameters
are
passed
by
copy
the
update
does
not
occur
To
reduce
ambiguity
increase
portability
and
avoid
situations
where
some
but
not
all
of
the
actual
parameters
are
updated
when
an
exception
is
raised
it
is
best
to
treat
values
of
out
and
in
out
parameters
like
state
variables
updating
them
only
after
it
is
certain
that
no
exception
will
be
raised

notes
A
reusable
part
could
range
from
a
low
level
building
block
e
g
data
structure
sorting
algorithm
math
function
to
a
large
reusable
subsystem
The
lower
level
the
building
block
the
less
likely
that
the
reusable
part
will
know
how
to
handle
exceptions
or
produce
meaningful
results
Thus
the
low
level
parts
should
propagate
exceptions
A
large
reusable
subsystem
however
should
be
able
to
handle
any
anticipated
exceptions
independently
of
the
variations
across
which
it
is
reused
Adaptability
Reusable
parts
often
need
to
be
changed
before
they
can
be
used
in
a
specific
application
They
should
be
structured
so
that
change
is
easy
and
as
localized
as
possible
One
way
of
achieving
adaptability
is
to
create
general
parts
with
complete
functionality
only
a
subset
of
which
might
be
needed
in
a
given
application
Another
way
to
achieve
adaptability
is
to
use
Ada
s
generic
construct
to
produce
parts
that
can
be
appropriately
instantiated
with
different
parameters
Both
of
these
approaches
avoid
the
error
prone
process
of
adapting
a
part
by
changing
its
code
but
have
limitations
and
can
carry
some
overhead
Anticipated
changes
that
is
changes
that
can
be
reasonably
foreseen
by
the
developer
of
the
part
should
be
provided
for
as
far
as
possible
Unanticipated
changes
can
only
be
accommodated
by
carefully
structuring
a
part
to
be
adaptable
Many
of
the
considerations
pertaining
to
maintainability
apply
If
the
code
is
of
high
quality
clear
and
conforms
to
well
established
design
principles
such
as
information
hiding
it
is
easier
to
adapt
in
unforeseen
ways
Complete
Functionality
guideline
Provide
core
functionality
in
a
reusable
part
or
set
of
parts
so
that
the
functionality
in
this
abstraction
can
be
meaningfully
extended
by
its
reusers
More
specifically
provide
initialization
and
finalization
procedures
for
every
data
structure
that
may
contain
dynamic
data
For
data
structures
needing
initialization
and
finalization
consider
deriving
them
when

from
the

source
rationale
This
functionality
is
particularly
important
in
designing
programming
an
abstraction
You
have
to
balance
the
completeness
of
the
abstraction
against
its
extensibility
Completeness
ensures
that
you
have
configured
the
abstraction
correctly
without
built
in
assumptions
about
its
execution
environment
It
also
ensures
the
proper
separation
of
functions
so
that
they
are
useful
to
the
current
application
and
in
other
combinations
to
other
applications
Extensibility
ensures
that
reusers
can
add
functionality
by
extension
using
tagged
type
hierarchies

In
designing
for
reuse
you
need
to
think
in
terms
of
clean
abstractions
If
you
provide
too
little
functionality
and
rely
on
your
reusers
to
extend
the
abstraction
they
risk
having
an
abstraction
that
lacks
cohesion
This
hodgepodge
abstraction
has
inherited
many
operations
not
all
of
which
are
necessary
or
work
together
When
a
reusable
part
can
be
implemented
reasonably
using
dynamic
data
then
any
application
that
must
control
memory
can
use
the
initialization
and
finalization
routines
to
guard
against
memory
leakage
Then
if
data
structures
become
dynamic
the
applications
that
are
sensitive
to
these
concerns
can
be
easily
adapted
The
predefined
types
Ada
Finalization
Controlled
or
Ada
Finalization
Limited
Controlled
provide
automatic
user
definable
initialization
adjustment
and
finalization
procedures
When
you
declare
controlled
types
and
objects
you
are
guaranteed
that
the
compiler
will
insert
the
necessary
calls
to
initialization
adjustment
and
finalization
making
your
code
less
error
prone
and
more
maintainable
When
overriding
the
Initialize
and
Finalize
routines
on
the
controlled
types
make
sure
to
call
the
parent
Initialize
or
Finalize
notes
The
example
illustrates
end
condition
functions
An
abstraction
should
be
automatically
initialized
before
its
user
gets
a
chance
to
damage
it
When
that
is
not
possible
it
should
be
supplied
with
initialization
operations
In
any
case
it
needs
finalization
operations
One
way
to
supply
the
initialization
and
finalization
operations
is
to
derive
the
abstraction
from
the
predefined
types
Ada
Finalization
Controlled
or
Ada
Finalization
Limited
Controlled
Wherever
possible
query
operations
should
be
provided
to
determine
when
limits
are
about
to
be
exceeded
so
that
the
user
can
avoid
causing
exceptions
to
be
raised
It
is
also
useful
to
provide
reset
operations
for
many
objects
To
see
that
a
reset
and
an
initiation
can
be
different
consider
the
analogous
situation
of
a
warm
boot
and
a
cold
boot
on
a
personal
computer
Even
if
all
of
these
operations
are
not
appropriate
for
the
abstraction
the
exercise
of
considering
them
aids
in
formulating
a
complete
set
of
operations
others
of
which
may
be
used
by
another
application
Some
implementations
of
the
language
link
all
subprograms
of
a
package
into
the
executable
file
ignoring
whether
they
are
used
or
not
making
unused
operations
a
liability
see
Guideline
8

5
In
such
cases
where
the
overhead
is
significant
create
a
copy
of
the
fully
functional
part
and
comment
out
the
unused
operations
with
an
indication
that
they
are
redundant
in
this
application
Generic
Units
guideline
Use
generic
units
to
avoid
code
duplication
Parameterize
generic
units
for
maximum
adaptability
Reuse
common
instantiations
of
generic
units
as
well
as
the
generic
units
themselves
rationale
Ada
does
not
allow
data
types
to
be
passed
as
actual
parameters
to
subprograms
during
execution
Such
parameters
must
be
specified
as
generic
formal
parameters
to
a
generic
unit
when
it
is
instantiated
Therefore
if
you
want
to
write
a
subprogram
for
which
there
is
variation
from
call
to
call
in
the
data
type
of
objects
on
which
it
operates
then
you
must
write
the
subprogram
as
a
generic
unit
and
instantiate
it
once
for
each
combination
of
data
type
parameters
The
instantiations
of
the
unit
can
then
be
called
as
regular
subprograms
You
can
pass
subprograms
as
actual
parameters
either
by
declaring
access
to
subprogram
values
or
generic
formal
subprogram
parameters
See
Guideline
5
3
4
for
a
discussion
of
the
tradeoffs
If
you
find
yourself
writing
two
very
similar
routines
differing
only
in
the
data
type
they
operate
on
or
the
subprograms
they
call
then
it
is
probably
better
to
write
the
routine
once
as
a
generic
unit
and
instantiate
it
twice
to
get
the
two
versions
you
need
When
the
need
arises
later
to
modify
the
two
routines
the
change
only
needs
to
be
made
in
one
place
This
greatly
facilitates
maintenance
Once
you
have
made
such
a
choice
consider
other
aspects
of
the
routine
that
these
two
instances
may
have
in
common
but
that
are
not
essential
to
the
nature
of
the
routine
Factor
these
out
as
generic
formal
parameters
When
the
need
arises
later
for
a
third
similar
routine
it
can
be
automatically
produced
by
a
third
instantiation
if
you
have
foreseen
all
the
differences
between
it
and
the
other
two
A
parameterized
generic
unit
can
be
very
reusable
It
may
seem
that
the
effort
involved
in
writing
generic
rather
than
nongeneric
units
is
substantial
However
making
units
generic
is
not
much
more
difficult
or
time
consuming
than
making
them
nongeneric
once
you
become
familiar
with
the
generic
facilities
It
is
for
the
most
part
a
matter
of
practice
Also
any
effort
put
into
the
development
of
the
unit
will
be
recouped
when
the
unit
is
reused
as
it
surely
will
be
if
it
is
placed
in
a
reuse
library
with
sufficient
visibility
Do
not
limit
your
thinking
about
potential
reuse
to
the
application
you
are
working
on
or
to
other
applications
with
which
you
are
very
familiar
Applications
with
which
you
are
not
familiar
or
future
applications
might
be
able
to
reuse
your
software
After
writing
a
generic
unit
and
placing
it
in
your
reuse
library
the
first
thing
you
are
likely
to
do
is
to
instantiate
it
once
for
your
particular
needs
At
this
time
it
is
a
good
idea
to
consider
whether
there
are
instantiations
that
are
very
likely
to
be
widely
used
If
so
place
each
such
instantiation
in
your
reuse
library
so
that
they
can
be
found
and
shared
by
others

rationale
For
a

component
to
be
usable
in
as
many
contexts
as
possible
it
should
minimize
the
assumptions
that
it
makes
about
its

and
should
make
explicit
any
assumptions
that
are
necessary
In
Ada
the
assumptions
made
by
generic
units
can
be
stated
explicitly
by
the
types
of
the
generic
formal
parameters
A
limited
private
generic
formal
type
prevents
the
generic
unit
from
making
any
assumptions
about
the
structure
of
objects
of
the
type
or
about
operations
defined
for
such
objects
A
private
nonlimited
generic
formal
type
allows
the
assumption
that
assignment
and
equality
comparison
operations
are
defined
for
the
type
Thus
a
limited
private
data
type
cannot
be
specified
as
the
actual
parameter
for
a
private
generic
formal
type
In
general
you
should
choose
the
private
or
limited
private
generic
formal
type
based
on
the
need
for
assignment
inside
a
generic
Limited
private
types
should
be
used
for
abstractions
that
do
not
need
assignment
as
in
the
first
two
examples
above
In
the
third
example
where
assignment
is
needed
a
type
derived
from
a
controlled
type
is
specified
to
ensure
that
the
correct
assignment
semantics
will
be
available
If
you
need
equality
in
the
body
of
the
generic
you
may
need
to
redefine
equality
as
well
to
get
the
correct
semantics
you
would
then
need
to
include
a
formal
generic
subprogram
parameter
for
the
function
The
situation
is
reversed
for
types
exported
by
a
reusable
part
For
exported
types
the
restrictions
specified
by
limited
and
limited
private
are
restrictions
on
the
user
of
the
part
not
on
the
part
itself
To
provide
maximum
capability
to
the
user
of
a
reusable
part
export
types
with
as
few
restrictions
as
possible
Apply
restrictions
as
necessary
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
exported
data
structures
and
the
abstraction
for
the
various
implementations
envisioned
for
that
generic
Because
they
are
so
restrictive
limited
private
types
are
not
always
the
best
choice
for
types
exported
by
a
reusable
part
In
a
case
where
it
makes
sense
to
allow
the
user
to
make
copies
of
and
compare
data
objects
and
when
the
underlying
data
type
does
not
involve
access
types
so
that
the
entire
data
structure
gets
copied
or
compared
then
it
is
better
to
export
a
nonlimited
private
type
In
a
case
where
it
makes
sense
to
allow
the
user
to
make
copies
of
and
compare
data
objects
and
when
the
underlying
data
type
involves
access
types
so
that
the
entire
data
structure
gets
copied
or
compared
then
it
is
better
to
export
a
controlled
type
and
an
overridden
equality
operation
In
cases
where
it
does
not
detract
from
the
abstraction
to
reveal
even
more
about
the
type
then
a
nonprivate
type
e
g
a
numeric
enumerated
record
or
array
type
should
be
used

of
generic
units
is

create

to
extend
a
tagged
type
In
this
situation
you
want
to
use
the
most
restrictive
type
as
the
generic
formal
type
that
is
a
formal
type
that
is
both
limited
and
abstract
When
you
instantiate
the
generic
if
the
actual
type
is
nonlimited
the
type
extension
will
also
be
nonlimited
In
the
generic
package
you
must
declare
the
type
extension
as
abstract
The
instantiator
of
the
generic
can
then
extend
the
type
again
to
achieve
the
desired
mixin
configuration
notes
The
predefined
packages

Direct

requirements

and

There
are
also
some
cases
where
you
must
use

private
formal
type
These
cases
arise
when
the
formal
type
has
an

discriminant
or
the

is
used
as

type
in
defining

that
itself
includes

rationale
A
sort
algorithm
can
be
described
independently
of
the
data
type
being
sorted
This
generic
procedure
takes
the
Element
data
type
as
a
generic
limited
private
type
parameter
so
that
it
assumes
as
little
as
possible
about
the
data
type
of
the
objects
actually
being
operated
on
It
also
takes
Data
as
a
generic
formal
parameter
so
that
instantiations
can
have
entire
arrays
passed
to
them
for
sorting
Finally
it
explicitly
requires
the
two
operators
that
it
needs
to
do
the
sort
Should
Precede
and
Swap
The
sort
algorithm
is
encapsulated
without
reference
to
any
data
type
The
generic
can
be
instantiated
to
sort
an
array
of
any
data
type

example
This
example
presents
a
series
of
different
techniques
that
can
be
used
to
generate
abstract
data
types
and
objects
A
discussion
of
the
merits
of
each
follows
in
the
rationale
section
below
The
first
is
an
abstract
data
object
ADO
which
can
be
used
to
encapsulate
an
abstract
state
machine
It
encapsulates
one
stack
of
integers

The
second
example
is
an
abstract
data
type
ADT
It
differs
from
the
ADO
by
exporting
the
Stack
type
which
allows
the
user
to
declare
any
number
of
stacks
of
integers
Because
multiple
stacks
may
now
exist
it
is
necessary
to
specify
a
Stack
argument
on
calls
to
Push
and
Pop

The
third
example
is
a
parameterless
generic
abstract

object
GADO
It
differs
from
the
ADO
the
first
example
simply
by
being
generic
so
that
the
user
can
instantiate
it
multiple
times
to
obtain
multiple
stacks
of

The
fourth
example
is
a
slight
variant
on
the
third
still
a
GADO
but
with
parameters
It
differs
from
the
third
example
by
making
the
data
type
of
the
stack
a
generic
parameter
so
that
stacks
of
data
types
other
than
Integer
can
be
created
Also
Maximum
Stack
Size
has
been
made
a
generic
parameter
that
defaults
to
100
but
can
be
specified
by
the
user
rather
than
a

from

in
the

rationale
The
biggest
advantage
of
an
ADT
over
an
ADO
or
a
GADT
over
a
GADO
is
that
the
user
of
the
package
can
declare
as
many
objects
as
desired
with
an
ADT
These
objects
can
be
declared
as
standalone
variables
or
as
components
of
arrays
and
records
They
can
also
be
passed
as
parameters
None
of
this
is
possible
with
an
ADO
where
the
single
data
object
is
encapsulated
inside
of
the
package
Furthermore
an
ADO
provides
no
more
protection
of
the
data
structure
than
an
ADT
When
a
private
type
is
exported
by
the
ADT
package
as
in
the
example
above
then
for
both
the
ADO
and
ADT
the
only
legal
operations
that
can
modify
the
data
are
those
defined
explicitly
by
the
package
in
this
case
Push
and
Pop
For
these
reasons
an
ADT
or
GADT
is
almost
always
preferable
to
an
ADO
or
GADO
respectively
A
GADO
is
similar
to
an
ADT
in
one
way
it
allows
multiple
objects
to
be
created
by
the
user
With
an
ADT
multiple
objects
can
be
declared
using
the
type
defined
by
the
ADT
package
With
a
GADO
even
a
GADO
with
no
generic
formal
parameters
as
shown
in
the
third
example
the
package
can
be
instantiated
multiple
times
to
produce
multiple
objects
However
the
similarity
ends
there
The
multiple
objects
produced
by
the
instantiations
suffer
from
all
restrictions
described
above
for
ADOs
they
cannot
be
used
in
arrays
or
records
or
passed
as
parameters
Furthermore
the
objects
are
each
of
a
different
type
and
no
operations
are
defined
to
operate
on
more
than
one
of
them
at
a
time
For
example
there
cannot
be
an
operation
to
compare
two
such
objects
or
to
assign
one
to
another
The
multiple
objects
declared
using
the
type
defined
by
an
ADT
package
suffer
from
no
such
restrictions
they
can
be
used
in
arrays
and
records
and
can
be
passed
as
parameters
Also
they
are
all
declared
to
be
of
the
same
type
so
that
it
is
possible
for
the
ADT
package
to
provide
operations
to
assign
compare
copy
etc
For
these
reasons
an
ADT
is
almost
always
preferable
to
a
parameterless
GADO
The
biggest
advantage
of
a
GADT
or
GADO
over
an
ADT
or
ADO
respectively
is
that
the
GADT
and
GADO
are
generic
and
can
thus
be
parameterized
with
types
subprograms
and
other
configuration
information
Thus
as
shown
above
a
single
generic
package
can
support
bounded
stacks
of
any
data
type
and
any
stack
size
while
the
ADT
and
ADO
above
are
restricted
to
stacks
of
Integer
no
more
than
100
in
size
For
this
reason
a
GADO
or
GADT
is
almost
always
preferable
to
an
ADO
or
ADT
The
list
of
examples
above
is
given
in
order
of
increasing
power
and
flexibility
starting
with
an
ADO
and
ending
with
a
GADT
These
advantages
are
not
expensive
in
terms
of
complexity
or
development
time
The
specification
of
the
GADT
above
is
not
significantly
harder
to
write
or
understand
than
the
specification
of
the
ADO
The

are
also

rationale
Iteration
over
complex
data
structures
is
often
required
and
if
not
provided
by
the
part
itself
can
be
difficult
to
implement
without
violating
information
hiding
principles
Active
and
passive
iterators
each
have
their
advantages
but
neither
is
appropriate
in
all
situations
Therefore
it
is
recommended
that
both
be
provided
to
give
the
user
a
choice
of
which
to
use
in
each
situation
Passive
iterators
are
simpler
and
less
error
prone
than
active
iterators
in
the
same
way
that
the
for
loop
is
simpler
and
less
error
prone
than
the
while
loop
There
are
fewer
mistakes
that
the
user
can
make
in
using
a
passive
iterator
Simply
instantiate
it
with
the
routine
to
be
executed
for
each
list
element
and
call
the
instantiation
for
the
desired
list
Active
iterators
require
more
care
by
the
user
Care
must
be
taken
to
invoke
the
iterator
operations
in
the
proper
sequence
and
to
associate
the
proper
iterator
variable
with
the
proper
list
variable
It
is
possible
for
a
change
made
to
the
software
during
maintenance
to
introduce
an
error
perhaps
an
infinite
loop
On
the
other
hand
active
iterators
are
more
flexible
than
passive
iterators
With
a
passive
iterator
it
is
difficult
to
perform
multiple
concurrent
synchronized
iterations
For
example
it
is
much
easier
to
use
active
iterators
to
iterate
over
two
sorted
lists
merging
them
into
a
third
sorted
list
Also
for
multidimensional
data
structures
a
small
number
of
active
iterator
routines
may
be
able
to
replace
a
large
number
of
passive
iterators
each
of
which
implements
one
combination
of
the
active
iterators
Finally
active
iterators
can
be
passed
as
generic
formal
parameters
while
passive
iterators
cannot
because
passive
iterators
are
themselves
generic
and
generic
units
cannot
be
passed
as
parameters
to
other
generic
units
For
either
type
of
iterator
semantic
questions
can
arise
about
what
happens
when
the
data
structure
is
modified
as
it
is
being
iterated
When
writing
an
iterator
be
sure
to
consider
this
possibility
and
indicate
with
comments
the
behavior
that
occurs
in
such
a
case
It
is
not
always
obvious
to
the
user
what
to
expect
For
example
to
determine
the
closure
of
a
mathematical
set
with
respect
to
some
operation
a
common
algorithm
is
to
iterate
over
the
members
of
the
set
generating
new
elements
and
adding
them
to
the
set
In
such
a
case
it
is
important
that
elements
added
to
the
set
during
the
iteration
be
encountered
subsequently
during
the
iteration
On
the
other
hand
for
other
algorithms
it
may
be
important
that
the
iterated
set
is
the
same
set
that
existed
at
the
beginning
of
the
iteration
In
the
case
of
a
prioritized
list
data
structure
if
the
list
is
iterated
in
priority
order
it
may
be
important
that
elements
inserted
at
lower
priority
than
the
current
element
during
iteration
not
be
encountered
subsequently
during
the
iteration
but
that
elements
inserted
at
a
higher
priority
should
be
encountered
In
any
case
make
a
conscious
decision
about
how
the
iterator
should
operate
and
document
that
behavior
in
the
package
specification
Deletions
from
the
data
structure
also
pose
a
problem
for
iterators
It
is
a
common
mistake
for
a
user
to
iterate
over
a
data
structure
deleting
it
piece
by
piece
during
the
iteration
If
the
iterator
is
not
prepared
for
such
a
situation
it
is
possible
to
end
up
dereferencing
a
null
pointer
or
committing
a
similar
error
Such
situations
can
be
prevented
by
storing
extra
information
with
each
data
structure
which
indicates
whether
it
is
currently
being
iterated
and
using
this
information
to
disallow
any
modifications
to
the
data
structure
during
iteration
When
the
data
structure
is
declared
as
a
limited
private
type
as
should
usually
be
the
case
when
iterators
are
involved
the
only
operations
defined
on
the
type
are
declared
explicitly
in
the
package
that
declares
the
type
making
it
possible
to
add
such
tests
to
all
modification
operations

notes
that
the
access
discriminant
and
type
extension
techniques
are
inversions
of
each
other
In
the
access
discriminant
approach
you
have
to
write
out
the
looping
mechanism
for
each
action
In
the
type
extension
approach
you
write
one
loop
and
dispatch
to
the
desired
action
Thus
an
iterator
that
uses
the
access
discriminant
technique
would
be
considered
active
while
an
iterator
that
uses
the
type
extension
technique
would
be
considered
passive
notes
You
can
use
an
access
to
subprogram
type
as
an
alternative
to
generic
instantiation
using
a
nongeneric
parameter
as
a
pointer
to
subprogram
You
would
then
apply
the
referenced
subprogram
to
every
element
in
a
collection

There
are

to
this

discusses
the
use
of
a
generic
template
to
define
the
properties
to
be
mixed
in
to
your
abstraction
The
generic
template
defines
the
mixin
The
type
supplied
as
generic
actual
parameter
determines
the
parent
the
body
provides
the
operations
and
the
specification
exports
the
extended
type
If
you
have
defined
a
series
of
generic
mixin
packages
you
would
then
serialize
the
instantiations
The
actual
parameter
to
the
next
instantiation
is
the
exported
tagged
type
from
the
previous
instantiation
This
is
shown
in
the
second
code
segment
in
the
example
Each
extension
is
derived
from
a
previous
extension
so
you
have
a
linearized
succession
of
overriding
subprograms
Because
they
are
linearized
you
have
a
derivation
order
you
can
use
to
resolve
any
conflicts
You
should
encapsulate
one
extension
and
related
operations
per
generic
package
This
provides
a
better
separation
of
concerns
and
more
maintainable
reusable
components

discussion

Independence
A
reusable
part
should
be
as
independent
as
possible
from
other
reusable
parts
A
potential
user
is
less
inclined
to
reuse
a
part
if
that
part
requires
the
use
of
other
parts
that
seem
unnecessary
The
extra
baggage
of
the
other
parts
wastes
time
and
space
A
user
would
like
to
be
able
to
reuse
only
that
part
that
is
perceived
as
useful
The
concept
of
a
part
is
intentionally
vague
here
A
single
package
does
not
need
to
be
independent
of
each
other
package
in
a
reuse
library
if
the
parts
from
that
library
that
are
typically
reused
are
entire
subsystems
If
the
entire
subsystem
is
perceived
as
providing
a
useful
function
the
entire
subsystem
is
reused
However
the
subsystem
should
not
be
tightly
coupled
to
all
the
other
subsystems
in
the
reuse
library
so
that
it
is
difficult
or
impossible
to
reuse
the
subsystem
without
reusing
the
entire
library
Coupling
between
reusable
parts
should
only
occur
when
it
provides
a
strong
benefit
perceptible
to
the
user
Subsystem
Design
guideline
Consider
structuring
subsystems
so
that
operations
that
are
only
used
in
a
particular
context
are
in
different
child
packages
than
operations
used
in
a
different
context
Consider
declaring
context
independent
functionality
in
the
parent
package
and
context
dependent
functionality
in
child
packages
rationale
The
generic
unit
is
a
basic
building
block
Generic
parameterization
can
be
used
to
break
dependencies
between
program
units
so
that
they
can
be
reused
separately
However
it
is
often
the
case
that
a
set
of
units
particularly
a
set
of
packages
are
to
be
reused
together
as
a
subsystem
In
this
case
the
packages
can
be
collected
into
a
hierarchy
of
child
packages
with
private
packages
to
hide
internal
details
The
hierarchy
may
or
may
not
be
generic
Using
the
child
packages
allows
subsystems
to
be
reused
without
incorporating
too
many
extraneous
operations
because
the
unused
child
packages
can
be
discarded
in
the
new
environment

source
rationale
Context
with
clauses
specify
the
names
of
other
units
upon
which
this
unit
depends
Such
dependencies
cannot
and
should
not
be
entirely
avoided
but
it
is
a
good
idea
to
minimize
the
number
of
them
that
occur
in
the
specification
of
a
unit
Try
to
move
them
to
the
body
leaving
the
specification
independent
of
other
units
so
that
it
is
easier
to
understand
in
isolation
Also
organize
your
reusable
parts
in
such
a
way
that
the
bodies
of
the
units
do
not
contain
large
numbers
of
dependencies
on
each
other
Partitioning
your
library
into
independent
functional
areas
with
no
dependencies
spanning
the
boundaries
of
the
areas
is
a
good
way
to
start
Finally
reduce
dependencies
by
using
generic
formal
parameters
instead
of
with
statements
as
shown
in
the
example
above
If
the
units
in
a
library
are
too
tightly
coupled
then
no
single
part
can
be
reused
without
reusing
most
or
all
of
the
library
The
first
nongeneric
version
of
Produce
And
Store
A
above
is
difficult
to
reuse
because
it
depends
on
Package
A
that
may
not
be
general
purpose
or
generally
available
If
the
operation
Produce
And
Store
has
reuse
potential
that
is
reduced
by
this
dependency
a
generic
unit
and
an
instantiation
should
be
produced
as
shown
above
The
with
clause
for
Package
A
has
been
moved
from
the
Produce
And
Store
generic
procedure
which
encapsulates
the
reusable
algorithm
to
the
Produce
And
Store
A
instantiation
Instead
of
naming
the
package
that
provides
the
required
operations
the
generic
unit
simply
lists
the
required
operations
themselves
This
increases
the
independence
and
reusability
of
the
generic
unit
This
use
of
generic
formal
parameters
in
place
of
with
clauses
also
allows
visibility
at
a
finer
granularity
The
with
clause
on
the
nongeneric
version
of
Produce
And
Store
A
makes
all
of
the
contents
of
Package
A
visible
to
Produce
And
Store
A
while
the
generic
parameters
on
the
generic
version
make
only
the
Produce
and
Store
operations
available
to
the
generic
instantiation
Generic
formal
packages
allow
for
safer
and
simpler
composition
of
generic
abstractions
Rationale
1995

The
generic
formal
package
allows
you
to
group
a
set
of
related
types
and
their
operations
into
a
single
unit
avoiding
having
to
list
each
type
and
operation
as
an
individual
generic
formal
parameter
This
technique
allows
you
to
show
clearly
that
you
are
extending
the
functionality
of
one
generic
with
another
generic
effectively
parameterizing
one
abstraction
with
another
Coupling
Due
to
Pragmas
guideline
In
the
specification
of
a
generic
library
unit
use
pragma
Elaborate
Body
example
source
lang
ada
generic
package
Stack
is
pragma
Elaborate
Body
Stack
in
case
the
body
is
not
yet
elaborated
end
Stack
with
Stack
package
My
Stack
is
new
Stack
package
body
Stack
is
begin
end
Stack
source
rationale
The
elaboration
order
of
compilation
units
is
only
constrained
to
follow
the
compilation
order
Furthermore
any
time
you
have
an
instantiation
as
a
library
unit
or
an
instantiation
in
a
library
package
Ada
requires
that
you
elaborate
the
body
of
the
generic
being
instantiated
before
elaborating
the
instantiation
itself
Because
a
generic
library
unit
body
may
be
compiled
after
an
instantiation
of
that
generic
the
body
may
not
necessarily
be
elaborated
at
the
time
of
the
instantiation
causing
a
Program
Error
Using
pragma
Elaborate
Body
avoids
this
by
requiring
that
the
generic
unit
body
be
elaborated
immediately
after
the
specification
whatever
the
compilation
order
When
there
is
clear
requirement
for
a
recursive
dependency
you
should
use
pragma
Elaborate
Body
This
situation
arises
for
example
when
you
have
a
recursive
dependency
i
e
package
A
s
body
depends
on
package
B
s
specification
and
package
B
s
body
depends
on
package
A
s
specification
notes
Pragma
Elaborate
All
controls
the
order
of
elaboration
of
one
unit
with
respect
to
another
This
is
another
way
of
coupling
units
and
should
be
avoided
when
possible
in
reusable
parts
because
it
restricts
the
number
of
configurations
in
which
the
reusable
parts
can
be
combined
Recognize
however
that
pragma
Elaborate
All
provides
a
better
guarantee
of
elaboration
order
because
if
using
this
pragma
uncovers
elaboration
problems
they
will
be
reported
at
link
time
as
opposed
to
a
run
time
execution
error
Any
time
you
call
a
subprogram
typically
a
function
during
the
elaboration
of
a
library
unit
the
body
of
the
subprogram
must
have
been
elaborated
before
the
library
unit
You
can
ensure
this
elaboration
happens
by
adding
a
pragma
Elaborate
Body
for
the
unit
containing
the
function
If
however
that
function
calls
other
functions
then
it
is
safer
to
put
a
pragma
Elaborate
All
on
the
unit
containing
the
function

If
you
use
either
pragma
Pure
or
Preelaborate
you
will
not
need
the
pragma
Elaborate
Body
The
idea
of
a
registry
is
fundamental
to
many
object
oriented
programming
frameworks
Because
other
library
units
will
need
to
call
it
during
their
elaboration
you
need
to
make
sure
that
the
registry
itself
is
elaborated
early
Note
that
the
registry
should
only
depend
on
the
root
types
of
the
type
hierarchies
and
that
the
registry
should
only
hold
class
wide
pointers
to
the
objects
not
more
specific
pointers
The
root
types
should
not
themselves
depend
on
the
registry

Part
Families
guideline
Create
families
of
generic
or
other
parts
with
similar
specifications
example
The
Booch
parts
Booch
1987
are
an
example
of
the
application
of
this
guideline
rationale
Different
versions
of
similar
parts
e
g
bounded
versus
unbounded
stacks
may
be
needed
for
different
applications
or
to
change
the
properties
of
a
given
application
Often
the
different
behaviors
required
by
these
versions
cannot
be
obtained
using
generic
parameters
Providing
a
family
of
parts
with
similar
specifications
makes
it
easy
for
the
programmer
to
select
the
appropriate
one
for
the
current
application
or
to
substitute
a
different
one
if
the
needs
of
the
application
change
notes
A
reusable
part
that
is
structured
from
subparts
that
are
members
of
part
families
is
particularly
easy
to
tailor
to
the
needs
of
a
given
application
by
substitution
of
family
members

rationale
Some
compilers
omit
object
code
corresponding
to
parts
of
the
program
that
they
detect
can
never
be
executed
Constant
expressions
in
conditional
statements
take
advantage
of
this
feature
where
it
is
available
providing
a
limited
form
of
conditional
compilation
When
a
part
is
reused
in
an
implementation
that
does
not
support
this
form
of
conditional
compilation
this
practice
produces
a
clean
structure
that
is
easy
to
adapt
by
deleting
or
commenting
out
redundant
code
where
it
creates
an
unacceptable
overhead
This
feature
should
be
used
when
other
factors
prevent
the
code
from
being
separated
into
separate
program
units
In
the
above
example
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
a
different
procedure
for
each
algorithm
But
the
algorithms
may
differ
in
slight
but
complex
ways
to
make
separate
procedures
difficult
to
maintain
caution
Be
aware
of
whether
your
implementation
supports
dead
code
removal
and
be
prepared
to
take
other
steps
to
eliminate
the
overhead
of
redundant

necessary
Table
Driven
Programming
guideline
Write
table
driven
reusable
parts
wherever
possible
and
appropriate
example
The
epitome
of
table
driven
reusable
software
is
a
parser
generation
system
A
specification
of
the
form
of
the
input
data
and
of
its
output
along
with
some
specialization
code
is
converted
to
tables
that
are
to
be
walked
by
preexisting
code
using
predetermined
algorithms
in
the
parser
produced
Other
forms
of
application
generators
work
similarly
rationale
Table
driven
sometimes
known
as
data
driven
programs
have
behavior
that
depends
on
data
with
ed
at
compile
time
or
read
from
a
file
at
run
time
In
appropriate
circumstances
table
driven
programming
provides
a
very
powerful
way
of
creating
general
purpose
easily
tailorable
reusable
parts
See

for
a
short
discussion
of
using
access
to
subprogram
types
in
implementing
table
driven
programs
notes
Consider
whether
differences
in
the
behavior
of
a
general
purpose
part
could
be
defined
by
some
data
structure
at
compile
or
run
time
and
if
so
structure
the
part

be
table
driven
The
approach
is
most
likely
to
be
applicable
when
a
part
is
designed
for
use
in
a
particular
application
domain
but
needs
to
be
specialized
for
use
in
a
specific

of

The
general
algorithm
can
depend
polymorphically
on

of
the
class
wide
type
of
the
root
tagged
type
without
caring
what
specialized

The

See

Furthermore
the
child
package
hierarchy
then
mirrors
the
inheritance
hierarchy
A
general
root
tagged
type
can
define
the
common
properties
and
have
common
operations
for
a
hierarchy
of
more
specific
types
Software
that
depends
only
on
this
root
type
will
be
general
in
that
it
can
be
used
with
objects
of
any
of
the
more
specific
types
Further
the
general
algorithms
of
clients
of
the

type
do
not
have
to
be
changed
as
more
specific
types
are
added
to
the

This
is
a
particularly
effective
way
to
organize
object

Separating
the
hierarchy
of

enhances
reusability

Introduction
This
chapter
recommends
ways
of
using
Ada
s
object
oriented
features
Ada
supports
inheritance
and
polymorphism
providing
the
programmer
some
effective
techniques
and
building
blocks
Disciplined
use
of
these
features
will
promote
programs
that
are
easier
to
read
and
modify
These
features
also
give
the
programmer
flexibility
in
building
reusable
components
The
following
definitions
are
provided
in
order
to
make
this
chapter
more
understandable
The
essential
characteristics
of
object
oriented
programming
are
encapsulation
inheritance
and
polymorphism
These
are
defined
as
follows
in
the
Rationale
1995

and

Inheritance
A
means
for
incrementally
building
new
abstractions
from
an
existing
one
by
inheriting
their
properties
without
disturbing
the
implementation
of
the
original
abstraction
or
the
existing
clients
Multiple
Inheritance
The
means
of
inheriting
components
and
operations
from
two
or
more
parent
abstractions
Mixin
Inheritance
Multiple
inheritance
in
which
one
or
more
of
the
parent
abstractions
cannot
have
instances
of
their
own
and
exist
only
to
provide
a
set
of
properties
for
abstractions
inheriting
from
them
Polymorphism
A
means
of
factoring
out
the
differences
among
a
collection
of
abstractions
such
that
programs
may
be
written
in
terms
of
the
common
properties
Static
polymorphism
is
provided
through
the
generic
parameter
mechanism
whereby
a
generic
unit
may
be
instantiated
at
compile
time
with
any
type
from
a
class
of
types
Dynamic
polymorphism
is
provided
through
the
use
of
so
called
class
wide
types
and
the
distinction
is
then
made
at
runtime
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
tag
effectively
a
hidden
discriminant
identifying
the
type
Rationale
1995
II

As
stated
in
the
Ada
Reference
Manual
1995
Annex
N
A
type
has
an
associated
set
of
values
and
a
set
of
primitive
operations
that
implement
the
fundamental
aspects
of
its
semantics
A
class
is
a
set
of
types
that
is
closed
under
derivation
which
means
that
if
a
given
type
is
in
the
class
then
all
types
derived
from
that
type
are
also
in
the
class
The
set
of
types
of
a
class
share
common
properties
such
as
their
primitive
operations
The
semantics
of
a
class
include
expected
behavior
and
exceptions
An
object
is
either
a
constant
or
variable
defined
from
a
type
class
An
object
contains
a
value
A
subcomponent
of
an
object
is
itself
an
object
Guidelines
in
this
chapter
are
frequently
worded
consider
because
hard
and
fast
rules
cannot
apply
in
all
situations
The
specific
choice
you
make
in
a
given
situation
involves
design
tradeoffs
The
rationale
for
these
guidelines
is
intended
to
give
you
insight
into
some
of
these
tradeoffs
Object
Oriented
Design
You
will
find
it
easier
to
take
advantage
of
many
of
the
concepts
in
this
chapter
if
you
have
done
an
object
oriented
design
The
results
of
an
object
oriented
design
would
include
a
set
of
meaningful
abstractions
and
hierarchy
of
classes
The
abstractions
need
to
include
the
definition
of
the
design
objects
including
structure
and
state
the
operations
on
the
objects
and
the
intended
encapsulation
for
each
object
The
details
on
designing
these
abstractions
and
the
hierarchy
of
classes
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
book
A
number
of
good
sources
exist
for
this
detail
including
Rumbaugh
et
al
1991
Jacobson
et
al
1992
Software
Productivity
Consortium
1993
and
Booch
1994
An
important
part
of
the
design
process
is
deciding
on
the
overall
organization
of
the
system
Looking
at
a
single
type
a
single
package
or
even
a
single
class
of
types
by
itself
is
probably
the
wrong
place
to
start
The
appropriate
level
to
start
is
more
at
the
level
of
subsystem
or
framework
You
should
use
child
packages
Guidelines
4
1

and
4
2

to
group
sets
of
abstractions
into
subsystems
representing
reusable
frameworks
You
should
distinguish
the
abstract
reusable
core
of
the
framework
from
the
particular
instantiation
of
the
framework
Presuming
the
framework
is
constructed
properly
the
abstract
core
and
its
instantiation
can
be
separated
into
distinct
subsystems
within
the
package
hierarchy
because
the
internals
of
an
abstract
reusable
framework
probably
do
not
need
to
be
visible
to
a
particular
instantiation
of
the
framework
Tagged
Type
Hierarchies
You
should
use
inheritance
primarily
as
a
mechanism
for
implementing
a
class
hierarchy
from
an
object
oriented
design
A
class
hierarchy
should
be
a
generalization

extension
when
designing
an
is
a

hierarchy
Use
tagged
types
to
preserve
a
common
interface
across

Taft
1995a
When
defining
a
tagged
type
in
a
package
consider
including
a
definition
of
a
general
access
type
to
the
corresponding
class
wide
type
In
general
define
only
one
tagged
type
per
package
example
Consider
the
type
structure
for
a
set
of
two

geometric
objects
positioned
in
a
Cartesian
coordinate
system
Barnes
1996
The
ancestor
or
root
type
Object
is
a
tagged
record
The
components
common
to
this
type
and
all
its
descendants
are
an
x
and
y
coordinate
Various
descendant
types
include
points
circles
and
arbitrary
shapes
Except
for
points
these
descendant
types
extend
the
root
type
with
additional
components
for
example
the
circle
adds
a
radius

rationale
You
can
derive
new
types
from
both
tagged
and
untagged
types
but
the
effects
of
this
derivation
are
different
When
you
derive
from
an
untagged
type
you
are
creating
a
new
type
whose
implementation
is
identical
to
the
parent
Values
of
the
derived
types
are
subject
to
strong
type
checking
thus
you
cannot
mix
the
proverbial
apples
and
oranges
When
you
derive
a
new
type
from
an
untagged
type
you
are
not
allowed
to
extend
it
with
new
components
You
are
effectively
creating
a
new
interface
without
changing
the
underlying
implementation
Taft
1995a
In
deriving
from
a
tagged
type
you
can
extend
the
type
with
new
components
Each
descendant
can
extend
a
common
interface
the
parent
s
The
union
of
a
tagged
type
and
its
descendants
form
a
class
and
a
class
offers
some
unique
features
not
available
to
untagged
derivations
You
can
write
class
wide
operations
that
can
be
applied
to
any
object
that
is
a
member
of
the
class
You
can
also
provide
new
implementations
for
the
descendants
of
tagged
types
either
by
overriding
inherited
primitive
operations
or
by
creating
new
primitive
operations
Finally
tagged
types
can
be
used
as
the
basis
for
multiple
inheritance
building
blocks

semantics
are
very
commonly
used
in
object
oriented
programming
In
particular
heterogeneous
polymorphic
data
structures
based
on
tagged
types
require
the
use
of
access
types
It
is
convenient
to
have
a
common
definition
for
such
a
type
provided
to
any
client
of
the
package
defining
the
tagged
type
A
heterogeneous
polymorphic
data
structure
is
a
composite
data
structure
such
as
an
array
whose
elements
have
a
homogeneous
interface
i
e
an
access
to
class
wide
type
and
whose
elements
implementations
are
heterogeneous
i
e
the
implementation
of
the
elements
uses
different
specific
types

on
polymorphism
and

on
managing
visibility
of
tagged
type
hierarchies
In
Ada
the
primitive
operations
of
a
type
are
implicitly
associated
with
the
type
through
scoping
rules
The
definition
of
a
tagged
type
and
a
set
of
operations
corresponds
together
to
the
traditional
object
oriented
programming
concept
of
a
class
Putting
these
into
a
package
provides
a
clean
encapsulation
mechanism
exceptions
If
the
root
of
the
hierarchy
does
not
define
a
complete
set
of
values
and
operations
then
use
an
abstract
tagged
type
see
Guideline
9

4
This
abstract
type
can
be
thought
of
as
the
least
common
denominator
of
the
class
essentially
a
conceptual
and
incomplete
type
If
a
descendant
needs
to
remove
one
of
the
components
or
primitive
operations
of
its
ancestor
it
may
not
be
appropriate
to
extend
the
tagged
type
An
exception
to
using
reference
semantics
is
when
a
type
is
exported
that
would
not
be
used
in
a
data
structure
or
made
part
of
a
collection
If
the
implementation
of
two
tagged
types
requires
mutual
visibility
and
the
two
types
are
generally
used
together
then
it
may
be
best
to
define
them
together
in
one
package
though
thought
should
be
given
to
using
child
packages
instead
see
Guideline
9

Also
it
can
be
convenient
to
define
a
small
hierarchy
of
completely
abstract
types
or
a
small
part
of
a
larger
hierarchy
all
in
one
package
specification
however
the
negative
impact
on
maintainability
may
outweigh
the
convenience
You
do
not
provide
a
package
body
in
this
situation
unless
you
have
declared
nonabstract
operations
on
members
of
the
hierarchy
Properties
of
Dispatching
Operations
guideline
The
implementation
of
the
dispatching
operations
of
each
type
in
a
derivation
class
rooted
in
a
tagged
type
T
should
conform
to
the
expected
semantics
of
the
corresponding
dispatching
operations
of
the
class
wide
type
T
Class
example
The
key
point
of
both
of
the
alternatives
in
the
following
example
is
that
it
must
be
possible
to
use
the
class

type

polymorphically
without
having
to
study
the
implementations
of
each
of
the
types
derived
from

type
Transaction
Object
In
addition
new
transactions
can
be
added
to
the
derivation
class
without
invalidating
the
existing
transaction
processing
code
These
are
the
important
practical
consequences
of
the
design
rule
captured
in
the
guideline

The
precondition
for
the
specific
operation
Pay

Execute
T
is
that
Pay

Is

T
is
True
which
is
the
same
precondition
as
for
the
dispatching
operation
Execute
on
the
class
wide
type
The
actual
validity
check
is
different
but
the
statement
of
the
precondition
is
the
same
The
postcondition
for
Pay
Transaction
Execute
T
includes
T
Has

True
but
also
includes
the
appropriate
condition
on

Data
for

you
had
not
defined
the
operation

on
transactions
then
the
validity
condition
for

computation
valid

hours

would
have
to

become

But
this
would
be
a
stronger
precondition
than
that
on
the

operation
violating
the
guideline
As
a
result
of
this
violation
there
would
be
no
way
to

the
precondition
of
a

call
to

leading
to
unexpected
failures
An
alternative
resolution
to
this
problem
is
to
define
an
exception
to
be
raised
by
an
Execute
operation
when
the
transaction
is
not
valid
This
behavior
becomes
part
of
the
semantic
model
for
the
class
wide
type
the
precondition
for
Execute
T
becomes
simply
True
i
e
always
valid
but
the
postcondition
becomes
either
the
exception
is
not
raised
and
Has
Executed
True
or
the
exception
is
raised
and
Has
Executed
False
The
implementations
of
Execute
in
all
derived
transaction
types
would
then
need
to
satisfy
the
new
postcondition
It
is
important
that
the
same
exception
be
raised
by
all
implementations
because
this
is
part
of
the
expected
semantic
model
of
the
class
wide
type

rationale
All
the
properties
expected
of
a
class
wide
type
by
clients
of
that
type
should
be
meaningful
for
any
specific
types
in
the
derivation
class
of
the
class
wide
type
This
rule
is
related
to
the
object
oriented
programming
substitutability
principle
for
consistency
between
the
semantics
of
an
object
oriented
superclass
and
its
subclasses
Wegner
and
Zdonik
1988
However
the
separation
of
the
polymorphic
class
wide
type
T
Class
from
the
root
specific
type
T
in
Ada
95
clarifies
this
principle
as
a
design
rule
on
derivation
classes
rather
than
a
correctness
principle
for
derivation
itself
When
a
dispatching
operation
is
used
on
a
variable
of
a
class
wide
type
T
Class
the
actual
implementation
executed
will
depend
dynamically
on
the
actual
tag
of
the
value
in
the
variable
In
order
to
rationally
use
T
Class
it
must
be
possible
to
understand
the
semantics
of
the
operations
on
T
Class
without
having
to
study
the
implementation
of
the
operations
for
each
of
the
types
in
the
derivation
class
rooted
in
T
Further
a
new
type
added
to
this
derivation
class
should
not
invalidate
this
overall
understanding
of
T
Class
because
this
could
invalidate
existing
uses
of
the
class
wide
type
Thus
there
needs
to
be
an
overall
set
of
semantic
properties
of
the
operations
of
T
Class
that
is
preserved
by
the
implementations
of
the
corresponding
dispatching
operations
of
all
the
types
in
the
derivation
class
One
way
to
capture
the
semantic
properties
of
an
operation
is
to
define
a
precondition
that
must
be
true
before
the
operation
is
invoked
and
a
postcondition
that
must
be
true
given
the
precondition
after
the
operation
has
executed
You
can
formally
or
informally
define
pre
and
postconditions
for
each
operation
of
T
Class
without
reference
to
the
implementations
of
dispatching
operations
of
specific
types
These
semantic
properties
define
the
minimum
set
of
properties
common
to
all
types
in
the
derivation
class
To
preserve
this
minimum
set
of
properties
the
implementation
of
the
dispatching
operations
of
all
the
types
in
the
derivation
class
rooted
in
T
including
the
root
type
T
should
have
the
same
or
weaker
preconditions
than
the
corresponding
operations
of
T
Class
and
the
same
or
stronger
postconditions
than
the
T
Class
operations
This
means
that
any
invocation
of
a
dispatching
operation
on
T
Class
will
result
in
the
execution
of
an
implementation
that
requires
no
more
than
what
is
expected
of
the
dispatching
operation
in
general
though
it
could
require
less
and
delivers
a
result
that
is
no
less
than
what
is
expected
though
it
could
do
more
exceptions
Tagged
types
and
type
extension
may
sometimes
be
used
primarily
for
type
implementation
reasons
rather
than
for
polymorphism
and
dispatching
In
particular
a
nontagged
private
type
may
be
implemented
using
a
type
extension
of
a
tagged
type
In
such
cases
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
the
implementation
of
the
derived
type
to
preserve
the
semantic
properties
of
the
class
wide
type
because
the
membership
of
the
new
type
in
the
tagged
type
derivation
class
will
not
generally
be
known
to
clients
of
the
type
Controlled
Types
guideline
Consider
using
a
controlled
type
whenever
a
type
allocates
resources
that
must
be
deallocated
or
otherwise
cleaned
up
on
destruction
or
overwriting
Use
a
derivation
from
a
controlled
type
in
preference
to
providing
an
explicit
cleanup
operation
that
must
be
called
by
clients
of
the
type
When
overriding
the
adjustment
and
finalization
procedures
derived
from
controlled
types
define
the
finalization
procedure
to
undo
the
effects
of
the
adjustment
procedure
Derived
type
initialization
procedures
should
call
the
initialization
procedure
of
their
parent
as
part
of
their
type
specific
initialization
Derived
type
finalization
procedures
should
call
the
finalization
procedure
of

as

Consider

The
following
example
demonstrates
the
use

in
the
implementation

Because
the

Abstract
Types
guideline
Consider
using
abstract
types
and
operations
in
creating
classification
schemes
for
example
a
taxonomy
in
which
only
the
leaf
objects
will
be
meaningful
in
the
application
Consider
declaring
root
types
and
internal
nodes
in
a
type

as

Consider
using
abstract
types
for
generic
formal
derived
types
Consider
using
abstract
types
to
develop
different
implementations
of

example
In
a
banking
application
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
account
types
each
with
different
features
and
restrictions
Some
of
the
variations
are
fees
overdraft
protection
minimum
balances
allowable
account
linkages
e
g
checking
and
savings
and
rules
on
opening
the
account
Common
to
all

are
ownership
attributes
unique
account

owner

s
and
owner
tax
identification
number
s
Common
operations
across
all
types
of
accounts
are
opening
depositing
withdrawing
providing
current
balance
and
closing
The
common
attributes
and
operations
describe
the
conceptual
bank
account
This
idealized
bank
account
can
form
the
root
of
a
generalization
specialization
hierarchy
that
describes
the
bank

of

By
using
abstract
tagged

you
ensure
that
only
account
objects
corresponding
to
a
specific
product
will
be
created
Because
any
abstract
operations
must
be
overridden
with
each
derivation
you
ensure
that
any

for
a
specialized

are
implemented

for
an
example
of
creating
an
abstraction
with
a
single
interface
and
the
potential
for
multiple
implementations
The
example
only
shows
one
possible
implementation
however
you
could
provide
an
alternate
implementation
of
the
Hashed
Set
abstraction
using
other
data
structures
rationale
In
many
classification
schemes
for
example
a
taxonomy
only
objects
at
the
leaves
of
the
classification
tree
are
meaningful
in
the
application
In
other
words
the
root
of
the
hierarchy
does
not
define
a
complete
set
of
values
and
operations
for
use
by
the
application
The
use
of
abstract
guarantees
that
there
will
be
no
objects
of
the
root
or
intermediate
nodes
Concrete
derivations
of
the
abstract
types
and
subprograms
are
required
so
that
the
leaves
of
the
tree
become
objects
that
a
client
can
manipulate
You
can
only
declare
abstract
subprograms
when
the
root
type
is
also
abstract
This
is
useful
as
you
build
an
abstraction
that
forms
the
basis
for
a
family
of
abstractions
By
declaring
the
primitive
subprograms
to
be
abstract
you
can
write
the
common
class
wide
parts
of
a
system
without
being
dependent
on
the
properties
of
any
specific
type
at
all

Abstract
types
and

can
help
you
resolve
problems
when

The
Rationale

explains
When
building
an
abstraction
that
is
to
form
the
basis
of
a
class
of
types
it
is
often
convenient
not
to
provide
actual
subprograms
for
the
root
type
but
just
abstract
subprograms
which
can
be
replaced
when
inherited
This
is
only
allowed
if
the
root
type
is
declared
as
abstract
objects
of
an
abstract
type
cannot
exist
This
technique
enables
common
class
wide
parts
of
a
system
to
be
written
without
being
dependent
on
the
properties
of
any
specific
type
at
all
Dispatching
always
works
because
it
is
known
that
there
can
never
be
any
objects
of
the
abstract
type
and
so
the
abstract
subprograms
could
never
be
called

make
use
of
abstract
tagged
types
The
basic
abstraction
is
defined
using
an
abstract
tagged
limited
private
type
whose
full
type
declaration
is
a
null
record
with
a
small
set
of
abstract
primitive
operations
While
abstract
operations
have
no
bodies
and
thus
cannot
be
called
they
are
inherited
Derivatives
of
the
abstraction
then
extend
the
root
type
with
components
that
provide
the
data
representation
and
override
the
abstract
operations
to
provide
callable
implementations
Rationale

This
technique
allows
you
to
build
multiple
implementations
of
a
single
abstraction
You
declare
a
single
interface
and
vary
the
specifics
of
the
data
representation
and
operation
implementation
notes
When
you
use
abstract
data
types
as
described
in
this
guideline
you
can
have
multiple
implementations
of
the
same
abstraction
available
to
you
within
a
single
program
This
technique
differs
from
the
idea
of
writing
multiple
package
bodies
to
provide
different
implementations
of
the
abstraction
defined
in
a
package
specification
because
with
the
package
body
technique
you
can
only
include
one
of
the
implementations
i
e
bodies
in
your
program
Tagged
Type
Operations
You
can
use
three
options
when
you
define
the
operations
on
a
tagged
type
and
its
descendants
These
categories
are
primitive
abstract
primitive
nonabstract
and
class
wide
operations
An
abstract
operation
must
be
overridden
for
a
nonabstract
derived
type
A
nonabstract
operation
may
be
redefined
for
a
subclass
A
class
wide
operation
cannot
be
overridden
by
a
subclass
definition
A
class
wide
operation
can
be
redefined
for
the
derivation
class
rooted
in
the
derived
type
however
this
practice
is
discouraged
because
of
the
ambiguities
it
introduces
in
the
code
Through
careful
usage
of
these
options
you
can
ensure
that
your
abstractions
preserve
class
wide
properties
as
discussed
in

As
stated
above
this
principle
requires
that
any
type
that
is
visibly
derived
from
some
parent
type
must
fully
support
the
semantics
of
the
parent
type
Primitive
Operations
and
Redispatching
guideline
Consider
declaring
a
primitive
abstract
operation
based
on
the
absence
of
a
meaningful
default
behavior
Consider
declaring
a
primitive
nonabstract
operation
based
on
the
presence
of
a
meaningful
default
behavior
When
overriding
an
operation
the
overriding
subprogram
should
not
raise
exceptions
that
are
not
known
to
the
users
of
the
overridden
subprogram
If
redispatching
is
used
in
the
implementation
of
the
operations
of
a
type
with
the
specific
intent
that
some
of
the
redispatched
to
operations
be
overridden
by
specializations
for
the
derived
types
then
document
this
intent
clearly
in
the
specification
as
part
of
the
interface
of
a
parent
type
with
its
derived

When

is
used

in

implementation
of

document

example
This
example
Volan

is
intended
to
show
a
clean
derivation
of
a
square
from
a
rectangle
You
do
not
want
to
derive
Square
from
Rectangle
because
Rectangle
has
semantics
that
are
inappropriate
for
Square
For
instance
you
can
make
a
rectangle
with
any
arbitrary
height
and
width
but
you
should
not
be
able
to
make
a
square
this
way
Instead
both
Square
and
Rectangle
should
be
derived
from
some
common
abstract
type

rationale
The
behavior
of
a
nonabstract
operation
can
be
interpreted
as
the
expected
behavior
for
all
members
of
the
class
therefore
the
behavior
must
be
a
meaningful
default
for
all
descendants
If
the
operation
must
be
tailored
based
on
the
descendant
abstraction
e
g
computing
the
area
of
a
geometric
shape
depends
on
the
specific
shape
then
the
operation
should
be
primitive
and
possibly
abstract
The
effect
of
making
the
operation
abstract
is
that
it
guarantees
that
each
descendant
must
define
its
own
version
of
the
operation
Thus
when
there
is
no
acceptable
basic
behavior
an
abstract
operation
is
appropriate
because
a
new
version
of
the
operation
must
be
provided
with
each
derivation
All
operations
declared
in
the
same
package
as
the
tagged
type
and
following
the
tagged
type
s
declaration
but
before
the
next
type
declaration
are
considered
its
primitive
operations
Therefore
when
a
new
type
is
derived
from
the
tagged
type
it
inherits
the
primitive
operations
If
there
are
any
operations
that
you
do
not
want
to
be
inherited
you
must
choose
whether
to
declare
them
as
class
wide
operations
see
Guideline
9

2
or
to
declare
them
in
a
separate
package
e
g
a
child
package
Exceptions
are
part
of
the
semantics
of
the
class
By
modifying
the
exceptions
you
are
violating
the
semantic
properties
of
the
class
wide
type
see
Guideline
9

There
are
at
least
two
distinct
users
of
a
tagged
type
and
its
primitives
The
ordinary
user
uses
the
type
and
its
primitives
without
enhancement
The
extending
user
extends
the
type
by
deriving
a
type
based
on
the
existing
tagged
type
Extending
users
and
maintainers
must
determine
the
ramifications
of
a
possibly
incorrect
extension
The
guidelines
here
try
to
strike
a
balance
between
too
much
documentation
that
can
then
easily
get
out
of
synch
with
the
actual
code
and
an
appropriate
level
of
documentation
to
enhance
the
maintainability
of
the
code
One
of
the
major
maintenance
headaches
associated
with
inheritance
and
dynamic
binding
relates
to
undocumented
interdependencies
among
primitive
dispatching
operations
of
tagged
types
the
equivalent
of
methods
in
typical
object
oriented
terminology
If
a
derived
type
inherits
some
and
overrides
other
primitive
operations
there
is
the
question
of
what
indirect
effects
on
the
inherited
primitives
are
produced
If
no
redispatching
is
used
the
primitives
may
be
inherited
as
black
boxes
If
redispatching
is
used
internally
then
when
inherited
the
externally
visible
behavior
of
an
operation
may
change
depending
on
what
other
primitives
are
overridden
Maintenance
problems
here
finding
and
fixing
bugs
occur
when
someone
overrides
incorrectly
on
purpose
or
by
accident
an
operation
used
in
redispatching
Because
this
overriding
can
invalidate
the
functioning
of
another
operation
defined
perhaps
several
levels
of
inheritance
up
from
the
incorrect
operation
it
can
be
extremely
difficult
to
track
down
In
the
object
oriented
paradigm
redispatching
is
often
used
to
parameterize
abstractions
In
other
words
certain
primitives
are
intended
to
be
overridden
precisely
because
they
are
redispatching
These
primitives
may
even
be
declared
as
abstract
requiring
that
they
be
overridden
Because
they
are
redispatching
they
act
as
parameters
for
the
other
operations
Although
in
Ada
much
of
this
parameterization
can
be
done
using
generics
there
are
cases
where
the
redispatching
approach
leads
to
a
clearer
object
oriented
design
When
you
document
the
redispatching
connection
between
the
operations
that
are
to
be
overridden
and
the
operations
that
use
them
you
make
the
intended
use
of
the
type
much
clearer
Hence
any
use
of
redispatching
within
a
primitive
should
be
considered
part
of
the
interface
of
the
primitive
at
least
as
far
as
any
inheritor
and
requires
documentation
at
the
specification
level
The
alternative
i
e
not
providing
such
documentation
in
the
specification
is
to
have
to
delve
deep
into
the
code
of
all
the
classes
in
the
derivation
hierarchy
in
order
to
map
out
the
redispatching
calls
Such
detective
work
compromises
the
black
box
nature
of
object
oriented
class
definitions
Note
that
if
you
follow

on
preserving
the
semantics
of
the
class
wide
dispatching
operations
in
the
extensions

problems

rationale
Constructor
operations
for
the
types
in
a
type
hierarchy
assuming
tagged
types
and
their
derivatives
usually
differ
in
their
parameter
profiles
The
constructor
will
typically
need
more
parameters
because
of
the
added
components
in
the
descendant
types
You
run
into
a
problem
when
you
let
constructor
operations
be
inherited
because
you
now
have
operations
for
which
there
is
no
meaningful
implementation
default
or
overridden
Effectively
you
violate
the
class
wide
properties
see
Guideline
9

1
because
the
root
constructor
will
not
successfully
construct
a
descendant
object
Inherited
operations
cannot
add
parameters
to
their
parameter
profile
so
these
are
inappropriate
to
use
as
constructors
You
cannot
initialize
a
limited
type
at
its
declaration
so
you
may
need
to
use
an
access
discriminant
and
rely
on
default
initialization
For
a
tagged
type
however
you
should
not
assume
that
any
default
initialization
is
sufficient
and
you
should
declare
constructors
For
limited
types
the
constructors
must
be
separate
procedures
or
functions
that
return
an
access
to
the
limited
type
The
example
shows
using
a
constructor
in
a
child
package
By
declaring
constructor
operations
in
either
a
child
package
or
a
nested
package
you
avoid
the
problems
associated
with
making
them
primitive
operations
Because
they
are
no
longer
primitive
operations
they
cannot
be
inherited
By
declaring
them
in
a
child
package
see

Guidelines

on
using

you
gain
the
ability
to
change
them

package
Taft
1995b
You
should
put
the
construction
logic
and
initialization
logic
in
distinct
subprograms
so
that
you
are
able
to
call

routine
for
the
parent
tagged
type
notes
When
you
extend
a
tagged
type
regardless
whether
it
is
an
abstract
type
you
can
choose
to
declare
as
abstract
some
of
the
additional
operations
Doing
so
however
means
that
the
derived
type
must
also
be
declared
as
abstract
If
this
newly
derived
type
has
inherited
any
functions
that
name
it
as
the
return
type
these
inherited
functions
now
also
become
abstract
Barnes

If
one
of
these
primitive

you
have

Equality
Test
source
rationale
Equality
is
applied
to
all
components
of
a
record
When
you
extend
a
tagged
type
and
compare
two
objects
of
the
derived
type
for
equality
the
parent
components
as
well
as
the
new
extension
components
will
be
compared
Therefore
when
you
redefine
equality
on
a
tagged
type
and
define
extensions
on
this
type
the
parent
components
are
compared
using
the
redefined
equality
The
extension
components
are
also
compared
using
either
predefined
equality
or
some
other
redefined
equality
if
appropriate
The
behavior
of
inherited
equality
differs
from
the
behavior
of
other
inherited
operations
When
other
primitives
are
inherited
if
you
do
not
override
the
inherited
primitive
it
can
only
operate
on
the
parent
components
of
the
object
of
the
extended
type
Equality
on
the
other
hand
generally
does
the
right
thing
Polymorphism
guideline
Consider
using
class
wide
programming
to
provide
run
time
dynamic
polymorphism
when
constructing
larger
reusable
extensible
frameworks
When
possible
use
class
wide
programming
rather
than
variant
records
Use
class
wide
programming
to
provide
a
consistent
interface
across
the
set
of
types
in
the
tagged
type
hierarchy
i
e
class
Consider
using
generics
to
define
a
new
type
in
terms
of
an
existing
type
either
as
an
extension
or
as
a
container
collection
or
composite
data
structure
Avoid
using
type
extensions
for
parameterized
abstractions
when
generics
provide
a
more
appropriate
mechanism
example
source
lang
ada
generic
type
Element
is
private
package
Stack
is
end
Stack
is
preferable
to
package
Stack
is
type
Element
is
tagged
null
record
Elements
to
be
put
on
the
stack
must
be
of
a
descendant
type
of
this
type
end
Stack
source
rationale
Both
generics
and
class
wide
types
allow
a
single
algorithm
to
be
applicable
to
multiple
specific
types
With
generics
you
achieve
polymorphism
across
unrelated
types
because
the
type
used
in
the
instantiation
must
match
the
generic
formal
part
You
specify
required
operations
using
generic
formal
subprograms
constructing
them
as
needed
for
a
given
instantiation
Generics
are
ideal
for
capturing
relatively
small
reusable
algorithms
and
programming
idioms
for
example
sorting
algorithms
maps
bags
and
iterators
As
generics
become
large
however
they
become
unwieldy
and
each
instantiation
may
involve
additional
generated
code
Class
wide
programming
including
class
wide
types
and
type
extension
is
more
appropriate
for
building
a
large
subsystem
because
you
avoid
the
additional
generated
code
and
unwieldy
properties
of
generics
Class
wide
programming
enables
you
to
take
a
set
of
heterogeneous
data
structures
and
provide
a
homogeneous
looking
interface
across
the
whole
set

on
using
tagged

to

data
In
object
oriented
programming
languages
without
generic
capabilities
it
was
common
to
use
inheritance
to
achieve
much
the
same
effect
However
this
technique
is
generally
less
clear
and
more
cumbersome
to
use
than
the
equivalent
explicit
generic

The
nongeneric
inheritance
approach
can
always
be
recovered
using
a

of
the

Managing
Visibility
Derived
Tagged
Types
guideline
Consider
giving
derived
tagged
types
the
same
visibility
to
the
parent
type
as
other
clients
of
the
parent
Define
a
derived
tagged
type
in
a
child
of
the
package
that
defines
the
base
type
if
the
implementation
of
the
derived
type
requires
greater
visibility
into
the
implementation
of
the
base
type
than
other
clients
of
the
base
type
require
example
The
following
example
illustrates
the
need
for
a
derived
type
to
have
greater
visibility
into
the
implementation
of
the
base
type
than
other
clients
of
the
base
type
In
this
example
of
a
stack
class
hierarchy
Push
and
Pop
routines
provide
a
homogeneous
interface
for
all
variations
of
stacks
However
the
implementation
of
these
operations
requires
greater
visibility
into
the
base
types
due
to
the
differences
in
the
data
elements

example

rationale
If
the
derived
type
can
be
defined
without
any
special
visibility
of
the
base
type
this
provides
for
the
best
possible
decoupling
of
the
implementation
of
the
derived
type
from
changes
in
the
implementation
of
the
base
type
On
the
other
hand
the
operations
of
an
extension
of
a
tagged
type
may
need
additional
information
from
the
base
type
that
is
not
commonly
needed
by
other
clients
When
the
implementation
of
a
derived
tagged
type
requires
visibility
of
the
implementation
of
the
base
type
use
a
child
package
to
define
the
derived
type
Rather
than
providing
additional
public
operations
for
this
information
it
is
better
to
place
the
definition
of
the
derived
type
in
a
child
package
This
gives
the
derived
type
the
necessary
visibility
without
risking
misuse
by
other
clients
This
situation
is
likely
to
arise
when
you
build
a
data
structure
with
a
homogeneous
interface
but
whose
data
elements
have
a
heterogeneous
implementation

Multiple
Inheritance
Ada
provides
several
mechanisms
to
support
multiple
inheritance
where
multiple
inheritance
is
a
means
for
incrementally
building
new
abstractions
from
existing
ones
as
defined
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
Specifically
Ada
supports
multiple

is
implemented
using
via
private

Assuming
you
have
defined
several
generics
with
these
additional

to
create
the
desired

you
use
a
combination
of
generic

could
instead
make

and
add

over

those
needed

the

The
following

Another
possibility
is
that
the

are
both
implemented
based
on
a
common

resulting
in
inheriting
a

Account
Object
To
resolve
this
ambiguity
you
need
to
use
an
abstract
type
hierarchy
for
the
multiple
inheritance
of
interface
and
separate
mixins
for
the
multiple
inheritance
of
implementation
rationale
In
other
languages
such
as
Eiffel
and
C
multiple
inheritance
serves
many
purposes
In
Eiffel
for
instance
you
must
use
inheritance
both
for
module
inclusion
and
for
inheritance
itself
Taft
1994
Ada
provides
context
clauses
for
module
inclusion
and
child
libraries
for
finer
modularization
control
Ada
does
not
provide
a
separate
syntax
for
multiple
inheritance
Rather
it
provides
a
set
of
building
blocks
in
type
extension
and
composition
that
allow
you
to
mix
in
additional
behaviors
A
library
of
mixins
allows
the
client
to
mix
and
match
in
order
to
develop
an
implementation
Also

about
implementing
mixins
You
should
not
use
multiple
inheritance
to
derive
an
abstraction
that
is
essentially
unrelated
to
its
parent
s
Thus
you
should
not
try
to
derive
a
menu
abstraction
by
inheriting
from
a
command
line
type
and
a
window
type
However
if
you
have
a
basic
abstraction
such
as
a
window
you
can
use
multiple
inheritance
mixins
to
create
a
more
sophisticated
abstraction
where
a
mixin
is
the
package
containing
the
type
s
and
operations
that
will
extend
the
parent
abstraction
Use
self
referential
data
structures
to
implement
types
with
full
multiple
inheritance
multiple
polymorphism
A
common
mistake
is
to
use
multiple
inheritance
for
parts
of
relations
When
a
type
is
composed
of
several
others
types
you
should
use
heterogeneous
data
structuring

Use

to
preserve

Taft
1995a
When

in
a

consider
including
a
definition
of
a
general

to
the
corresponding
class

In

The
implementation
of
the
dispatching
operations
of
each
type
in
a
derivation
class
rooted
in
a

should
conform
to
the
expected

of
the
corresponding
dispatching
operations
of
the

Consider
using
a
controlled
type
whenever
a

allocates

that
must
be
deallocated
or
otherwise
cleaned
up
on
destruction
or
overwriting
Use
a
derivation
from
a

in
preference
to
providing
an
explicit

operation
that
must
be
called
by
clients
of

Introduction
In
many
ways
performance
is
at
odds
with
maintainability
and
portability
To
achieve
improved
speed
or
memory
usage
the
most
clear
algorithm
sometimes
gives
way
to
confusing
code
To
exploit
special
purpose
hardware
or
operating
system
services
non
portable
implementation
dependencies
are
introduced
When
concerned
about
performance
you
must
decide
how
well
each
algorithm
meets
its
performance
and
maintainability
goals
Use
the
guidelines
in
this
chapter
with
care
they
may
be
hazardous
to
your
software
The
best
way
to
build
a
system
that
satisfies
its
performance
requirements
is
through
good
design
You
should
not
assume
that
speeding
up
your
code
will
result
in
a
visible
increase
in
system
execution
In
most
applications
the
overall
throughput
of
the
system
is
not
defined
by
the
execution
speed
of
the
code
but
by
the
interaction
between
concurrent
processes
and
the
response
time
of
the
system
peripherals
Most
of
the
guidelines
in
this
chapter
read
when
measured
performance
indicates
Indicates
means
that
you
have
determined
that
the
benefit
in
increased
performance
to
your
application
in
your
environment
outweighs
the
negative
side
effects
on
understandability
maintainability
and
portability
of
the
resulting
code
Many
of
the
guideline
examples
show
the
alternatives
that
you
will
need
to
measure
in
order
to
determine
if
the
guideline
is
indicated
Performance
Issues
Performance
has
at
least
four
aspects
execution
speed
code
size
compilation
speed
and
linking
speed
Although
all
four
are
important
most
people
think
of
execution
speed
when
performance
is
mentioned
and
most
of
the
guidelines
in
this
chapter
focus
on
execution
speed
Performance
is
influenced
by
many
factors
including
the
compilation
software
hardware
system
load
and
coding
style
While
only
coding
style
is
typically
under
the
control
of
the
programmer
the
other
factors
have
so
much
influence
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
flat
statements
such
as
case
statements
are
more
efficient
than
if
then
else
structures
When
performance
is
critical
you
cannot
assume
that
a
coding
style
that
proves
more
efficient
on
one
system
will
also
be
more
efficient
on
another
Decisions
made
for
the
sake
of
performance
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
testing
the
alternatives
on
the
actual
system
on
which
the
application
will
be
fielded
Performance
Measurement
While
most
well
known
tools
for
measuring
performance
are
stand
alone
programs
that
concentrate
on
execution
speed
there
is
a
comprehensive
tool
that
covers
all
four
aspects
of
performance
The
Ada
Compiler
Evaluation
System
ACES
is
the
result
of
merging
two
earlier
products
the
United
States
Department
of
Defense
s
Ada

and
the
United

It
offers
a
comprehensive
set
of
nearly
2
000
performance
tests
along
with
automated
setup
test
management
and
analysis
software
This
system
reports
and
statistically
analyzes
compilation
time
linking
time
execution
time
and
code
size
The
analysis
tools
make
comparisons
among
multiple
compilation
execution
systems
and
also
provide
comparisons
of
the
run
time
performance
of
tests
using
different
coding
styles
to
achieve
similar
purposes

While
measuring
performance
may
seem
to
be
a
relatively
straightforward
matter
there
are
significant
issues
that
must

by
any

rationale
Late
initialization
allows
a
compiler
more
choices
in
register
usage
optimization
Depending
on
the
circumstance
this
may
introduce
a
significant
performance
improvement
Some
compilers
incur
a
performance
penalty
when
declarative
blocks
are
introduced
Careful
analysis
and
timing
tests
by
the
programmer
may
identify
those
declarative
blocks
that
should
be
removed
notes
It
is
difficult
to
accurately
predict
through
code
inspections
which
declarative
blocks
improve
performance
and
which
degrade
performance
However
with
these
general
guidelines
and
a
familiarity
with
the
particular
implementation
performance
can
be
improved
Data
Structures
Dynamic
Arrays
guideline
Use
constrained
arrays
when
measured
performance
indicates
rationale
If
array
bounds
are
not
known
until
run
time
then
calculations
of
these
bounds
may
affect
run
time
performance
Using
named
constants
or
static
expressions
as
array
bounds
may
provide
better
performance
than
using
variables
or
nonstatic
expressions
Thus
if
the
values
of
Lower
and
Upper
are
not
determined
until
run
time
then
is
array
Lower
Upper
of
may
cause
address
and
offset
calculations
to
be
delayed
until
run
time
introducing
a
performance
penalty
See
NASA
1992
for
a
detailed
discussion
of
the
tradeoffs
and
alternatives
Zero
Based
Arrays
guideline
Use
zero
based
indexing
for
arrays
when
measured
performance
indicates
rationale
For
some
compilers
offset
calculations
for
an
array
whose
lower
bound
is
0
either
the
integer
zero
or
the
first
value
of
an
enumeration
type
are
simplified
For
other
compilers
optimization
is
more
likely
if
the
lower
bound
is
1
Unconstrained

Some
compilers
will
allocate
the
maximum
possible
size
to
each
object
of
the
type
others
will
use
pointers
to
the
dependent
components

examples
Record
and

Aggregates
guideline
Use
a
sequence
of
assignments
for
an
aggregation
when
measured
performance
indicates
rationale
Determine
the
impact
of
using
an
aggregate
versus
a
sequence
of
assignments
Using
an
aggregate
generally
requires
the
use
of
a
temporary
variable
If
the
aggregate
is
static
i
e
its
size
and
components
are
known
at
compile
or
link
time
allowing
link
time
allocation
and
initialization
then
it
will
generally
be
more
efficient
than
a
sequence
of
assignments
If
the
aggregate
is
dynamic
then
a
series
of
assignments
may
be
more
efficient
because
no
temporary
variable
is
needed

Constraint
Checking
guideline
Use

constraint

when

indicates

In
this
example
two
potential
constraint
checks
are
eliminated
If
the
function
Get
Response
returns
String
then
the
initialization
of
the
variable
Input
would
require
constraint

the

end

source
rationale
Because
run
time
constraint
checking
is
associated
with
slow
performance
it
is
not
intuitive
that
the
addition
of
constrained
subtypes
could
actually
improve
performance
However
the
need
for
constraint
checking
appears
in
many
places
regardless
of
the
use
of
constrained
subtypes
Even
assignments
to
variables
that
use
the
predefined
subtypes
may
need
constraint
checks
By
consistently
using
constrained
subtypes
many
of
the
unnecessary
run
time
checking
can
be
eliminated
Instead
the
checking
is
usually
moved
to
less
frequently
executed
code
involved
in
system
input
In
the
example
the
function
Get
Response
may
need
to
check
the
length
of
a
user
supplied
string
and
raise
an
exception
Some
compilers
can
do
additional
optimizations
based
on
the
information
provided
by
constrained
subtypes
For
example
although
an
unconstrained
array
does
not
have
a
fixed
size
it
has
a
maximum
size
that
can
be
determined
from
the
range
of
its
index
Performance
can
be
improved
by
limiting
this
maximum
size
to
a
reasonable
number

discussion
on
unconstrained
arrays
found
in

Pragmas

When
measured
performance
indicates

Assign

Assign

end
Assign
source
rationale
If
calling
overhead
is
a
significant
portion
of
a
subprogram
s
execution
time
then
using
pragma
Inline
may
reduce
execution
time
Procedure
and
function
invocations
include
overhead
that
is
unnecessary
when
the
code
involved
is
very
small
These
small
routines
are
usually
written
to
maintain
the
implementation
hiding
characteristics
of
a
package
They
may
also
simply
pass
their
parameters
unchanged
to
another
routine
When
one
of
these
routines
appears
in
some
code
that
needs
to
run
faster
either
the
implementation
hiding
principle
needs
to
be
violated
or
a
pragma
Inline
can
be
introduced
The
use
of
pragma
Inline
does
have
its
disadvantages
It
can
create
compilation
dependencies
on
the
body
that
is
when
the
specification
uses
a
pragma
Inline
both
the
specification
and
corresponding
body
may
need
to
be
compiled
before
the
specification
can
be
used
As
updates
are
made
to
the
code
a
routine
may
become
more
complex
larger
and
the
continued
use
of
a
pragma
Inline
may
no
longer
be
justified
exceptions
Although
it
is
rare
inlining
code
may
increase
code
size
which
can
lead
to
slower
performance
caused
by
additional
paging
A
pragma
Inline
may
actually
thwart
a
compiler
s
attempt
to
use
some
other
optimization
technique
such
as
register
optimization
When
a
compiler
is
already
doing
a
good
job
of
selecting
routines
to
be
inlined
the
pragma
may
accomplish
little
if
any
improvement
in
execution
speed
